5.0 out of 5 stars,"I was quite skeptical before buying this considering the price and Noise cancelation quality. Guess what, it turned out to be a great decision putting money in this buy.
JBL 650BT Live is an excellent active Noise cancellation headset. It delivers an optimum sound quality. Plus you get inbuilt Google assistant and Alexa to do your chores. It can read out notifications, call or message someone, set a reminder and many more, all you've to say ok Google or Alexa. I've been using it for 3months, here is my review. I've been using spotify to listen songs and results are amazing.

Pros:
Good active noise cancellation.
Great sound quality.
Easy to wear.
Buttons are responsive. No lag.
Clear sound during calls.
Fast bluetooth connectivity.
Can pair two devices at once. Laptop and phone.
Comfortable earcups - surrounds your ear.
Quick charge time. 2hrs for full charge.
Great battery back up. Close to 20hrs with noise cancellation on.
No discomfort on long usage.
Good carry pouch included.
Adjustable size option.
Dual connectivity, bluetooth and aux cable.
Even without noise cancellation on, sounds decent.

Cons:
Ears become a bit sweaty on long usage.
Bit heavier than usual headset.
With noise cancellation on, have to increase volume level on noisy areas, say at 70% volume.
When there is no song playing, you'll hear a little of surrounding noise, but that's ok.not discomforting.
Button sizes are small, takes time to adjust.
To change songs via headset, you've to hold volume up button for 3 secs, that's annoying sometimes.
Bass level is moderate. But that's ok. High bass seekers may not like it.

Overall, it's an excellent buy.

5.0 out of 5 stars,"Firstly i hv many headphones and earphones like ath m50x ,one more triple drivers,anker soundcore liberty air,some boat ones and sony ones too ,but in sb m se jbl or ath m50x or triple drivers are excellent!
Ath m50x are more balanced headphones,but that doesn't mean that jbl sounds bad! ,Jbl are almost equally good trust me ,well balanced with little bass( not overpowering) ,highs,mids and lows everything is just incredibly exceptional in this price point with active noise cancellation feature! ,M enjoying jbl's sound more than anything i hv!
I even hv many jbl models but all having bass heavy sound signature!
These are very balanced with required perfect bass!
ANC is good! Not like sony and bose ,but in this price range these are steal ,these are better than plantronics backbeat pro 2 in terms of ANC and sound quality is way way better than those!",Reviewed in India on 20 June 2019,Exceptional at this price point! Blindly go for it!
4.0 out of 5 stars,"Do not expect really high noise cancellation from this product. This works just fine when you need a wireless headset around your ear which can cut the noise.The cups has got nice padding but a bit on a heavier side. So wearing it day long might be painful.Gets connects to android device effortlessly, no complaint.Noise cancellation works; not that effective but definitely works by reducing noise around. Perfectly works at office space where anyways I do not expect people shouting. Benefit is you are really aware of your surroundings when you are enjoying music; be it when you are travelling or when you are in the middle of office space.",Reviewed in India on 30 July 2019,"Budget OENC headset, overall good product at this price point!"
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Simply the best in this price.
The bass is good, and the sound quality is pretty good.
The noise cancellation is amazing. You will actually feel the difference while the noise cancellation is on.
The battery backup could’ve been better, but still it gives 15-20hrs with noise cancellation on. Otherwise 30hrs.
The build quality is at par with any headphones in this category.
The only drawbag I found was the quality of calling. The sound is somewhat low.
But otherwise, absolutely worth it 👌🏻",Reviewed in India on 3 July 2019,Great product.
5.0 out of 5 stars,"This was my first experience of using a noise cancelling headphone so I don't have a set benchmark by Sony or Bose but the experience is good. The product oozes with premium feeling and the moment you hold it, you get a feeling of good build quality. Also thanks to Amazon for delivering the product so quickly despite the current situation.

So now, I have been using them for 3-4 days and here are my thoughts:-
The build quality at first feels that it's a little stiff but now it has become very comfortable
The instrument separation and bass is very good. The surround sound experience in them is a treat.
The noise cancelling is really good. Can't hear anything but music when it's on.

Really happy with it overall",Reviewed in India on 22 May 2020,TRULY MARVELLOUS
2.0 out of 5 stars,"I Got these headphones on 4th of July 2020 as soon as i got them i plugged them in for charging waiting to have these on my head, surprisingly the audio Quality is more than what i expected, thumping base but equal preference to Mids and Lows, Active Noise cancellation is great, did not expect the kind of noise cancelation for this price, fairly comfortable on ears, no complaints so far.... but then i Noticed you tube videos skip automatically without any intervention, i tried skipping the video back to what i was watching by the back button on the headphones but to my awe it wasnt working, the videos, this is so frustrating and the good solid bummer is the volume rocker doesnt work either ah schmuck.....i completely ignored this... i was really dosappointed as basic functionality doesnt work, looks like a complete failure of quality control, its highly disappointing that an amazing sounding pair of cans missed out on this basic check, i have a one glaring advise to JBL... please get your quality control going, a humble request...",Reviewed in India on 4 July 2020,Sound quality is great for the price but functions do not work
4.0 out of 5 stars,"Very comfortable to wear despite having a bit of weight in the product.
Wore it for 3-4 hours straight and it only felt a little strenuous by the end.

Sound quality is typical JBL and the bass does pretty decently.
Jazz sounds just amazing with the active noise cancelling.

Don’t expect the best active noise cancellation but does take off the ambient miscellaneous noises.

Don’t expect you wont be hearing traffic on a busy road but will simmer down the chatter from a filled metro compartment.",Reviewed in India on 6 October 2019,Great price for active noise cancellation. Worth the cost.
3.0 out of 5 stars,"Arrived yesterday, the packing was flawless and jaw dropping awesome. Headphones and all accessories looked premium and the build seems solid and well crafted.The noise cancellation was worked like a charm. Takes out most disturbing stuff out.The bad was sound quality. Played Pitbull's Hey Baby at full volume, and could clearly hear the bass cracking and making a crackling noise. Made the volume to half to adjust it. But still wasn't impressed by the treble and bass experience.Being a bass heavy headphones, it didn't work as per my expectations. Scheduled a return today after asking a few reviews from friends.",Reviewed in India on 3 October 2019,"Good looks, great noise cancellation, not good enough sound."
3.0 out of 5 stars,"Noise cancellation: something-is-better-than-none category good
Sound quality: awesome at mid volume. Cracks when high.
Calls: you can't hear yourself when on calls. You will either talk low or yell
Connectivity: connects in split second
Comfort: memory foam fits nice after 10 odd hours of use. A bit slippery after that though. Gets warm. Ear hurts (but mine are bigger than normal)
App: useless
Battery level: no way of knowing!",Reviewed in India on 31 May 2020,Average BT headphones. ANC is a plus.
5.0 out of 5 stars,"A good headphones with a great battery life and fast charging

Best thing: Can be connected to 2 devices

Good things: Quite comfortable (but still need to remove it in sometime, especially in hot weather)

Worst thing: Bass is a little on lower side. But it works for most people (at-least for me) as audio quality in general is quite good.

Note: The noise cancellation is quite normal, but really good for the price point.

Addition features I wanted: ambient aware and talk-through.

For headphones around 10k range, this is the best option I feel.",Reviewed in India on 17 July 2020,Best at this price point
3.0 out of 5 stars,"Ordered this one for my sister. Took 4-5 days to deliver. The headphones paired easily and worked fine for a couple days. After that, the touch pad and buttons stopped responding altogether. Returned and ordered a replacement.

The replacement seems to be a returned product, since inside the box, the packaging was not the same as the first one. Nevertheless, decided to keep this one to avoid the hassle of returning the product again; my sister was in desperate need for over ear headphones.

The noise cancellation is seems OK, though ambient sounds do creep in. The sound quality is good and making phone calls is a good experience too. However, with the noise cancellation on, sometimes the audio quality fluctuates after using for an hour or so. Not sure how to describe the change though :(.

Overall, don't think I would recommend these to anybody.",Reviewed in India on 17 September 2019,Decent headphones with some reliability issues
4.0 out of 5 stars,"Well i wanted to try out a decent headphone. I wanted to purchase bose, just because it is too comfortable. But price was huge factor.
This one from JBL is the best they have made so far. After using for more then 3 months here is what I feel about my new headphone
Pros:
1. Comfort: This headphone is comfortable and can be easily put on for hours. Comfort was something I wanted badly in a headphone.
2. Sound: I am not a hardcore headphone user. I found the sound good enough for a normal users.
3. Battery: One of the 5 star feature. Battery gets charged superfast. And it last for longer duration. Never measured in hours because i don't have to.
4: wireless/connectivity: Very easily connected to device. I have never used a wire with the headphone because the bluetooth mode is smooth and keeps away from wires.
Cons:
1. NC: No music and NC on, you can hear what people are saying, it doesn't cancel that. With music on 80-90 percentage of noise cancellation, someone shouting right infornt of you, i bet you can hear that. Increase a bit of volume, it becomes the true NC headphone. Overall I will call it a decent effort given the price range in the NC category.
2. Case: Hard case would have been better. We get a cloth bag which is good too.

In a category of NC headphone with good sound, great comfort and mid price range, i will say it is a very good buy.
If you are looking for a fully NC headphone then there go for Bose or Sony(high range models)
I hope this will be useful to anyone planning to purchase a decent headphone.",Reviewed in India on 18 October 2019,Good value for money
5.0 out of 5 stars,"After wearing for 10-15mins only you start to feel pain in your outer ear. Cushions are good but it will press on your ear.

On and off button not sure what’s was the reason behind slide, you need to practice a lot initially for more than 3sec

Noise cancellation button is bit loose, and sometimes when you use it will start to on and off automatically

Sound quality good, not as great as you hear from sony, sennheiser as I used both but wired one.

Good battery life I get a day in full charge.",Reviewed in India on 22 August 2020,Nice product
1.0 out of 5 stars,"Although headphone connects for music, the buttons and Google assistant do not work.

Tried it with (OnePlus or Samsung). Definitely a problem with the connectivity. Not sure if others faced this issue. Have requested for return now.

On a side note, for the 10 minutes that I tried it, the sound quality is excellent. Noise cancellation really did not make much of a difference. Buttons not working was the turn off for me.",The manufacturer commented on the review below,Bluetooth connected for audio to play. But control buttons are not working.
2.0 out of 5 stars,"Ear starts paining after 5 minutes of use.. too heavy.. sound quality is also not upto the mark.. on high volume ,sound starts distorting..noise cancelling can not be distinguished than when it is off..not recommended.. better go for sony or beats by dr dre.",Reviewed in India on 21 July 2019,Not recommended
2.0 out of 5 stars,"First impressions when I opened the Box, saw the seal was open. But it looked superb. Could easily catch anyone's eyes while you wear them, great build deisgn.

Pro's :
1. Great built quality and design. Don't worry at all on breaking, it won't.
2. Noise cancellation was surprisingly good, didn't expect at all for it to perform but it does a fair job. Don't expect bose or Sony level ANC 😜.
3. Decent battery life and charge timing.
4. This headphones has its own game in Sound profile, I liked it.
5. Call quality was good enough, was able to hear adequate sound while talking.
Con's:
1. Trying to connect bluetooth every time with my mobile or Ipad is so much pain. It atleast easily takes 3 to 4 tries to get it successfully connected. And forget about connecting 2 devices at a time and switch it, I got tried connecting it to one device.
2. Buttons on the headset won't work at most of time, and especially when you need it.
3. Google assistant was just a joke in it, touch pad was good but sometime it picks up my commands rarely.
4. I felt the camp pressure was bit more, I couldn't use it for 1hr on continous usage.
Conclusion:
Even though it states big features, I don't think it was able to deliver it. I can't compramise on basic features that makes me use the headphone daily like buttons, connectivity and comfort. On other side looks make it look so permium but I felt they are hugely let down.

Get it if you use it for a casual occasion and want it to be stylish but other wise hard to recommend without it being fully functional.",Reviewed in India on 5 March 2020,Doesn't deliver what it states!
1.0 out of 5 stars,I had high expectation on jbl. But everything is gone now. This headphones is not worth for 10k. I bought this in offer and immediately returned it next day. Sound quality is bad. Bass is even more bad. And noise cancellation is pathetic. The headphones worth 1k will work better than this. If you are music lover and badly looking for headphones. Please dont buy this.,The manufacturer commented on the review below,Not worth for the price
1.0 out of 5 stars,"Please don't buy this headphone. After 1year the volume buttons, play/pause button, Google assistant touch surface control are not working. There is no provision to repair or replace as it is out of the warranty.

Sound Quality : I will say average for the price. If you are a bass lover you will be disappointed. Bass is there but it misses the punches.

If you are using the provided Aux cable, sound quality as well as max loudness drastically decrease.

Noise Cancelation : Isolation due to the cuff is good, though active noise cancellation is average, but I will say that is ok at this price.

Battery Life : Battery life is good",The manufacturer commented on the review below,Stopped Working after 1year
5.0 out of 5 stars,"The sound quality is great. Noise cancelling works to an extent, but don't expect Bose level noise cancellation here.

I got a faulty piece. The headphone works with the aux cable and also with Bluetooth to an extent. But the Bluetooth volume and play/pause buttons do not seem to work, which defeats the entire purpose of having Bluetooth in the first place., and hence can't receive calls on the headphone, and cant control volume/next/previous tracks on the connected device. Have asked for a replacement. Will update after I get the same.

Update: The headphone was replaced with a proper working item. No complaints so far. Sound quality is good. Not too much bass, comparatively balanced sound. Sound quality improves with noise cancelling enabled. And it sounds even better via the cable (with NC on).",Reviewed in India on 19 July 2020,Good headphones
3.0 out of 5 stars,"An average product with an average performance. If you are comparing with Bose Noise cancellation headphones there is no match. They are pretty heavy .

I heard that jbl speakers are damn good so I thought headphones are superb too but to me, the sound quality is just like my earphone from HTC smartphone. Nothing special. Noise cancelation? It works but not that much. However, the seller is commendable for being prompt and reliable through it's delivery.",Reviewed in India on 27 July 2019,Product is nice but did not meet my expectations
4.0 out of 5 stars,"Really awesome sound and noise cancelling is also good. Music with bass is very clear and awesome. I tried listening to 3d and 8d sounds with the headphones and the results are very good. Don't worry about bass effect at all..

Ear cup could have been little wider as you have to adjust. It may not be a problem for all though. Feels like air is sucked in the ear. But it's better once you adjust as per your comfort. It's not big drawback.

Finish is very good as well. Charges very soon.

One needs to remove from the ear once in half hour or hour if you are continuously on head phones so you don't feel any itch due to the heat.

Definitely worth buying compared to models in Sony and Bose with high prices.",Reviewed in India on 19 June 2020,Great product to buy !!!

5.0 out of 5 stars,"At first i received a defective product because there wasn't any bass till i had to maximize the sound level and even the left hand side was making a mechanical sound. I was really disappointed.
Then i requested for a replacement and got them after a few days but this time i got the product right. As everything is in good shape and even the bass is good and deep.
Just the noise cancellation is not upto the point but at this price i don't think there's any better product with such a good sound and bass as compared to sony, skullcandy and senneheiser.
The design is really cool and the product is very sturdy. The sound quality is just awesome with deep bass but not earthquake like. It's too comfy and one can listen upto 5-6 hours straight. Here's the product review:-
Design- 9/10 (can get better)
Performance- 10/10 ( can also use the JBL app)
Build Quality- 9/10 ( as compared to others)
Bass- 9/10 ( not too much thumpy but deep )
Sound Quality - 10/10 ( that's JBL for you)
Noise Cancellation- 5/10
Comfort- 9/10 ( as they used faux leather)
Mic- 7/10 ( ok but can be improved a lot)
Battery- 10/10 ( charge for a while and enjoy)
Controls- 8/10 ( not easy to locate at first while using)
Connectivity- 8/10 ( can get connected upto two devices but connectivity can be improved)
Price- 10/10

5.0 out of 5 stars,"Got this beast delivered within a day. The below review is based on hardly one day use. Will share the long-term review later.

Packaging: The unboxing experience was premium. The way packaging is done makes you feel premium, gives you assurance that yes, you’ve ordered a premium headphone.

In the Box: In the box, you get headphones, Aux Cable (superb quality), charging cable and a carrying pouch with large JBL logo in one side. I wish charging cable would have been “C” type.

Built Quality: The built quality of headphone is good. They’re largely built from plastic, but they don’t feel cheap or weak, and expecting them to withstand the day to day use. The headband is made of metal covered with fabric material. It looks really good but also creates an opportunity to attract dust. I hope over a period of time the premium feel should fade away.

Noise Cancelling: At this price point, these are the best noise cancelling headphones available. Though we cannot compare it to that of Bose or Sony which are almost three times costlier. These headphones do this job close to 80% compared to Bose or Sony.

Comfort: These are not only good-looking headphones but comfortable too. They do have a good amount of padding around the ear cups and cushion under the headband. Initially you’ll feel these headphones a little heavy, but after using it for some longer time, you’ll be used to it. I feel these are comfortable for longer duration of use too.

Sound Quality: Now come to the main function. Sound Quality as usual for JBL, is awesome. High, Mid, Low everything is well tuned. Bass Lovers will love the sound of this headphone. You also get an option to download and use the app called “My JBL Headphones” for enhanced sound experience. The app has three pre-set equalizers setting, “Bass, Jazz & Vocal”. I prefer to use this equalizer only for listening music (preferred Jazz). For watching movies / series, I will suggest to keep the equalizer off as default sound setting is excellent enough to give you those mind blowing sound effects. Since this is bass heavy sound output, sometimes you don’t get that much crystal clear HD sound compared to Sony, Bose or Sennheiser. But overall great sound.

Performance: Bluetooth range is good enough. I think this headphones use Bluetooth 4.1 which should give range upto 30 feets. Regarding battery backup, I think I should not comment now it's hardly a day I've been using it.

Final Verdict: If you want good looking premium headphones with good noise cancelling and sound quality, but the budget is constrained, without any second thought, GO FOR IT.",Reviewed in India on 19 June 2019,Awesome Purchase
5.0 out of 5 stars,"JBL Live 650 BTNC Review

I’m writing this detailed review of JBL Headphones after about a week of usage.
I pre-ordered these Headphones from Amazon and got them for 9.5 k.

Design 4/5: The JBL Live 650 BTNC are well-designed over-ear headphones. They are well-built headphones and their control scheme is easy to use. However, like most over-ears, they aren't the most portable option and won’t be ideal for sports as they trap heat inside the cups and aren’t stable enough for running

Comfort 5/5: The Live 650 BTNC are comfortable headphones. The padding on the cups is quite soft and their overall design feels fairly lightweight.

Build Quality 5/5: These are very well built Headphones. They feel very durable. The cups are dense enough and should survive a few accidental falls without too much damage. The headband is solid thanks to a reinforcing metal sheet, yet it is still fairly flexible.

Sound 5/5: The JBL Live 650 BTNC are good sounding closed-back over-ear headphones. They have a deep and powerful bass, a very well-balanced mid-range, and a great treble. Their bass is overly thumpy, but fans of bass-heavy genres may prefer this.
Bass heads will love these headphones because of the Extra Bass Sound Signature of these headphones.

Noise Isolation 5/5: These are the only Noise Isolation Headphones available Under 25000 bucks WITH EXTRA BASS SOUND SIGNATURE. The only other Headphones with similar Features are Beats Studio 3 which will set you back for 25k. So it’s pretty impressive to have Active Noise Cancellation at this price with Amazing sound quality.

Call Quality 2/5: These Headphones have pretty mediocre call quality. You have to speak louder than usual, only then the person at the receiving end can hear you properly.

Battery 5/5: With their ANC enabled, you will get about 22 hours of continuous playback with these headphones. They only take just under 2 hours to charge fully, which is good.

Connectivity 5/5: The JBL Live 650 BTNC are Bluetooth compatible headphones that can be simultaneously connected to two devices. This can be very useful if you often change between a work computer and your phone. Also, their wireless range is remarkable. You can use them wired, even if the battery is dead, and their audio cable has an in-line microphone that is compatible with most devices like gaming consoles, which is nice.

Conclusion: I Purchased these Headphones after reading enormous amounts of detailed reviews, comparing these headphones with the alternatives available from Sony, Skullcandy, Sennheiser, etc.

4.0 out of 5 stars,"I'd say the best feature of this headphone is the comfort. You can wear it for hours together and not feel any discomfort. The next thing is sound quality. I found it to be good in terms of both bass and clarity. I'd say it's a little too clear, the downside being there is a minor issue with sibilance at default settings. The 's' and 't' come out sharply especially with female voices. I found that if you turn down the entire 'bass' profile in the jbl app by 1 step (ie. lower the entire frequency curve by a bit) this goes away. Lastly, the noise cancelation is average. It cuts off low rumbling sounds very well (like ac, central cooling) but people speaking, television noise, cellphone speaker playing etc. pass through. I got it for 7k from another site and for that price it's worth it. At 10.5k, I'd go with something else.",Reviewed in India on 12 November 2019,Good headphones if it buy for less than 8k
1.0 out of 5 stars,"These heaphones have a good sound signature for the price, all frequencies are well audible. Battery life is excellent. Google assistant works by tapping on the left ear cup. Noise cancelling is average at best. You can wear them comfortably for hours without discomfort. Ear cups aren't tight. AUX cable is braided with one end being 2.5mm to be connected to the headphones, and 3.5mm for the audio port. Now moving to the bad part.

I purchased this from a Croma retail store near my home about last year. It's still under warranty period. The stitching came apart on it's own without any mechanical damage done to it. I have been extremely careful while handling it. To my horror, JBL does not replace the ear cushions or the headphones when there is physical damage. They do not cover physical damage in their warranties which is really absurd. They don't cover water damage either so what does their warranty cover?? DO NOT BUY THEM! The durability is horrible!! The sales people at Croma specifically told me that if the cushion tears off, it will be replaced by the manufacturer.

JBL has left me utterly disappointed. Till date I have purchased their products, due to their excellent after sales support, good quality sounding headphones. I'll be taking my business elsewhere after this experience.",The manufacturer commented on the review below,"Horrible durability with no replacement for ear cushions, with a non existent warranty."

,"I wanted so much to like the headphones, however, they are let down in a number of areas, which mens they only get 3 stars and will be going back to Amazon later this week.

As a standard pair of bluetooth headphones, they perform adequately well. The sound is good, not as good as I'd have liked, but not bad.
Construction is good. A bit too plasticy maybe, and the buttons are rather tricky to find when wearing them, but over all OK. I am a size 58 head, and the headphones grip quite hard so I think if I was wearing them for a few hours, like on a plane journey, I'd struggle with them.

Alas, the good points end there.

Now the not so good.

Pairing with both my android phone and Amazon tablet took a lot of time and retries. Eventually I managed to pair them, but in order to pair to the tablet, I have to turn off bluetooth on the phone first. They will not pair to a different device if an existing one isn't active. Not had that happen with other equipment.

The headphones are meant to work with both Google Assistant and Amazon Alexa (Have to choose one from the Android app (Alas, no Amazon app, so no way to do so from an Amazon tablet unless side loading).
OK(ish) so far.
The following is mostly about Alexa as I use that more than Google Assistant.

Again, just like the pairing, it was a bit of a faff getting the headphones and Alexa to pair.
Once paired, it seems to work for a little while, but then somehow either the headphones or the Alexa app stop communicating and everytime you brush the left earpiece you get a screeching ""You have no connection, Either connect to the devise or restart the Assistant application"" or something similar.
In other words, you've lost the assistant completely. In order to get it back, have to shut down/restart earphones and/or Alexa. A few times.......

Noise Cancelling. Given this is the major feature for these headphones, I was very very disappointed. I have up to new used a set of Bose QC15s, which are nearing the end of their life, hence looking for replacement ANCs.
The Bose headphones, despite being at least 6 years old cut out all humming and noise. I have used them on noisy trains, planes, boats, etc. They work and the background noise is, despite them being ON ear only just brilliant.

I was expecting at least same, if not better from the JBL set, given they are new, hence I expected newer technology. Alas, I am really disappointed. The ANC is really the worst feature of the headphones.
I tested then in the car and they hardly cut out the engine noise at all. Bose ones did 100% almost.

This evening, I did a test with all my headsets, some on ear, some over. Only the Bose and the JBL are ANCs.

I had a SF program on, which had lots of background noise (Starship engine hum, etc).
Result:
Bose: 100% cut out of background noise.
JBL: Some loss of background noise, but hardly any difference if ANC on or off.
Other headphones: Performed about as well as JBL, despite no ANC.

OK, not a scientific test, I grant you, but as good a test as I need to know they aren't up to spec.

So, in conclusion, I have to surmise that on a plane/train/etc, these JBL headphones will be practically useless in terms of ANC, thus making them totally pointless.

Alas, I tried to hard to like them...

So, going back to Amazon later this week and I'll now consider sticking to Bose and just biting the bullet and spending a lot more money.

Not recommended as main features don't work.",Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 7 November 2019,
,"This product was extremely disappointed and though I was very excited to receive these and they didn’t live up at all to my expectations. To start, the headphones easily fell off my head whenever I was running or cycling or doing something active. The noise cancelling is okay although it doesn’t block out all wind or chatter which makes it slightly pointless. However the worst part about it was the terrible sound quality and the fact that you could receive better quality from £25 apple earphones or something similar to this price is inexcusable for such expensive headphones. This product was a huge regret and I would make sure to get something worthy of the price in the headphone market.",Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 11 February 2020,
,"I love these headphones. Noise cancellation is great. You can't hear all the car buzz around you. It works without listening to the music which is an added value. I can finally take a break from a constant noise ( I live next to the busy road and 2 pubs). The headphones are big. The good thing about this is that they cover whole ears, but they would work better for a bigger head than mine. They can't be regulated and I find them a bit heavy though I am really happy with them.",Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 8 August 2020,

,"The JBL LIVE 650BTNC are a good looking, comfortable noise cancelling headphone.Taking them out of the box; it's hard not to admire their looks. There aren't grills, mesh and they don't have the shiny plastic of Beats just a subtle look. Putting them on the ear cups are nice and soft; and despite the July heat these are comfortable headphone even In long use. The headband is a little stiff which despite the plastic makes them feel well made. There could be a bit more padding on the headband; it's wrapped in a plastic mesh.

From the box they needed charging; sadly this is via a micro usb cable; though this likely helps keep the cost down. JBL include a bright orange cable to help you charge them. In the box you also get a slip case to transport then, a headphone cable - which has an inline microphone; but not a two pin aeroplane adaptor. For calls users preferred the microphone on the cable to the built in microphones.

You turn them on through a nice positive sliding switch on the right ear cup. The power up and connect to my iPhone nice and quickly. The noise cancelling comes on by default; and It is a scorched earth noise cancelling. This is great for planes and commuting on buses and trains. In a hot July I'm sat next to a fan listening to them and I can't hear the fan; a foot away. With the TV on in the room I can hear very muted voices; though high pitched sounds like the selection beep are more noticeable.

Once charged the battery life on and off during the week for me was around 18 hours with ANC on all the time; realistically its not very often i'm away from power for that long. Once drained a 15 minute charge allowed for me around 2 - 2 and half hours of battery so you need not be away from peace and quiet for too long.

Like a lot of ANC headphones JBL have added support for the Alexa and google assistant integration. I have a few headphones that support this feature; but with the JBL it has become something really useable and offers a better experience. Unlike other headphones; the assistant isn't activated by a small button or an action on a touch surface - the centre of the left ear cup is like a big button to activate the assistant. I have a preference for the google assistant. It reads out messages; works with hangouts - and you can reply to both. Of course lets you do some degree of search. Whilst the microphone on the headsets didn't go over too well on calls; they worked great for speaking to google.

I cant compliment the other controls on the headphones they are a bit of a usability disaster. There are 5 hard to distinguish buttons on the right ear cup. Even if you know what each one does; they are hard to differentiate by touch alone. JBL use the; up volume - multifunction centre and down volume. Its hard to find the centre button even though it is slightly recessed. It's almost impossible to find the noise cancellation control button, colocated with the bluetooth button. The buttons themselves work with a nice positive click; though they barely move when you press them.

Audio wise out of the box they are bass heavy for my taste and that overwhelms my delicate textured musical tastes; it works pretty well with rock music. JBL's app lets you retune the sound to suit your taste; and that let me reduce the bass. There are a few presets to get you started; you can't make them as musical as . The app like the rest of the headphones is a bit basic; but it does the job. You get a more neutral and wide ranging sound from B&O's H9i - but not twice the price worth. They do suffer from the same issue with walking around outside in them I had with the H9's the ANC doesn't work too well with movement and wind noise. Reducing the ANC setting a notch (if you can find the button) helps in this regard.

As a heavy traveller I have been using noise cancelling headphones for over a decade to ease my journeys; for this the JBL's are great. The Diesel engine of my train to London melted away; even with the music off. Heathrow terminal 5 and a flight to Krakow were both made in peace - and this is the benefit of ANC - you don't need to listen to something if you just want quiet they work well . My biggest gripe with the JBL's are the controls are ill thought out; and you really have to use your phone to make calls as the microphones aren't up to it. Spend some time with the EQ in the app and you can tune the sound to be close to your preference.

If your budget gets you to these headphones; you will be happy with the JBL's. Feature wise you won't be missing out on important things compared to higher priced alternatives.",Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 6 July 2019,
,"Excellent headphones with great sound quality and a decent amount of noise cancellation.I wouldn't say you can't hear anything when you're using them, but some lower vibration sounds are definitely cancelled out (which was the main reason I got them).Overall happy with my purchase. =)",Reviewed in Germany on 28 July 2020,
,"Use it on daily base (2-4) hours, battery lasts for whole work week. Installed them in 2 minutes (win 10), never had issue with them regarding bluetooth. Noise cancelation is awesome. Music playing from headphones can not be heard to other people until 80-85% volume is reached. There is really no need to go above it.",Reviewed in Germany on 13 October 2019,
,"Let's go for the positives first:

+ Amazing sound! And it's easy to tweak if you prefer it different from the excellent default settings. Love the bass
+ Collapsible and with a solid design that I expect to last long especially if stored in the enclosed bag while not in use
+ Alexa and Google assistant support (if you use it. It can be disabled in the app).
+ Premium look and comfort. Mostly plastic, but it's durable, has some metallic features and a soft headband and nice cushions that will fit over most ears. They stay well in place.
+ a good battery life!

The not so good
- my biggest problem with these is if they are used outside even on days where there is very little wind, the wind will be amplified and distort the sound. As the sound is already not as high as I would have expected, it is very annoying and I find it almost impossible to listen to podcasts while walking as the wind sound is so annoying
- I have found that it has taken me a while to get used to the buttons. It will likely be easier for people that have used this type frequently, but as I have most often simply used the phone controls, it is still a bit hit n miss for me and until you set up the initial settings, you will be prompted by the voice assistant to get it sorted if you accidentally hit a button while eg adjusting the headphones.
- the noise cancellation works, but it is weaker than some I've tried from other big brands (which were also more expensive).
- the price on Amazon is £229, but with JBL it's £179, which is much more in line with the quality.

So to recap; the sound is absolutely amazing if you're inside or in non-windy conditions, but as soon as there is even a slight breeze, it sounds like you're caught in a storm and it's really ruining the experience of using these headphones outside - and I would certainly not try running or otherwise exercising with them. So this will all depend on where you use them. If it's simply for commuting or mostly indoors, they will likely be a great choice as the sound is beautiful and you have all the features you would get from other, more expensive, wireless over-ear headphones, but as I use mine going to and from work every day where I will be out and about in sometimes slightly windy conditions, these are not working so well for me and that's disappointing.",Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 3 July 2019,
,"I've had quite a few headphones in my time from companies like Bose and Sennheiser albeit not the at the very high end, certainly several hundred pounds worth of good and these headphones are right up there. If I'm being fussy then the noise cancelling is not as good as the best Sennheisers I've had. Anyway enough of the comparative here's the empirical:

I found these headphones to be very comfortable and adjustment to optimise the fit very easy with just the right amount of resistance not to move when you're moving around with them. The over ear pads are supremely comfortable, I mean I've fallen asleep wearing these listening to chill out tunes, and the headband has enough texture to grip your hair/head to not move during use front to back. They just seem optimised in terms of their build, the materials used and the build quality. They are definitely worth the money.

In terms of sound quality the noise cancelling does make a noticeable difference to some of the mid range and the bass is never quite enough but pretty good. Maybe i was spoiled by the Sennheisers. Whoops slipped back to the comparative narrative there. One thing I noticed in use was the volume level didn't stay where you left it the last time you disconnected. Not sure if this was the headphones fault or some dodgy Apple coding. They are very loud and if you don't notice the volume is on maximum it can give you a bit of a start!

I never used the Alexa/google assistant stuff as I mostly have that turned off. If I wanted people to eavesdrop on my conversations I'd open a window and shout. However I did use them to make phone calls and they worked pretty well with or without the cord. The battery life was about what was promised in the blurb and they would recharge even from low power USB sockets unlike my iPad.

Overall these are blinding value for money and I would be happy to replace these for the same with my own money if they broke. Considering they cost a fraction of what my noise cancelling Sennheisers cost me (even they eventually broke, a victim of my clumsiness), they are stonking good value. So even though the NC and Sound isn't up to the same level as my old Sennheisers, I'm still going to give them a well deserved five stars.",Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 25 February 2020,
,"In the box you get the headset, the charging cable, a detachable audio cable with remote and a carrying pouch. These are Bluetooth headphones but they also have an aux in cable outlet. The cable fits my ancient MP3 player. This paired no problem with my phone and tablet. There are all the usual controls on the side of one of the speakers.To use the Alexa app you need to navigate to the device page of your phone and add the device. You can then use Alexa on via the headphones. You can ask all the usual questions. This isn't too useful if you already have Alexa indoors, but this does mean you can also use Alexa outside in the garden, say.According to the instructions, you can also set the headphones up with Google Assistant. However, I haven't tried that.The sound quality is excellent. The headphones are a snug and comfortable fit over both my ears and my wife is. There is a good amount of padding over the head and over the ear. They are adjustable. From the noise-canceling point of view, it's only really effective if you're playing music. Otherwise basically you just have an expensive pair of ear defenders. The noise-canceling advantage is less effective for audio books or the spoken word.Why only 4 stars? The quality is there but they are a little heavy. According to the instructions, they weigh in at 260g.

Sound quality is great and the noise cancelling works well. Very comfortable to wear and look very smart.

Connection was very easy and works well via Bluetooth.

Slightly negative points
*The buttons, which are very small, are all on one side of the headphones so will take a little use to get used to the positioning for answer calls/ using the volume buttons.
* A few issues connecting to google assistant but seems to be ok now.
*The my JBL headphone app isn't great, 2.2 review on the Play store, which isn't great for a £200+ bit of gear.

My only thing that really has irritated me about these new headphone is the choice of charger connection - it's a Micro-USB when all Android phones are moving to USB-C so it will mean you need to carry two different cables or an adapter with you.

,"The black and gold styled version of these 'phones look great! I like the noise cancelling and the other features - e.g. connection to 2 devices simultaneously via bluetooth, and the ability to connect via a cable (which can constitute a 3rd device!) so I would highly recommend.

Negatives:
Comfort: I found that the fit was a little tight, I've noticed others describing that it works well for there smaller heads and I have the opposite problem. The cups and band are nice and soft however.
Sound - it took a little manipulation to get the sound I like - it was incorrectly, IMHO configured out of the factory with too much bass.

Positives:
Battery life: Great! as advertised, easy to get through the day and put on charge (I would say a Type C connector would have helped here too)
Styling: looks really good, and folds away quite nicely into the provided sturdy bag.
Connectivity: it's really useful to have up-to 3 (1 wired) devices ready to go without much messing about with Bluetooth reconnection, etc.

It comes with a charging cable and an audio jack lead for wired connections where bluetooth is not available. Sadly, and I have gone on about this very same thing with a number of high end goods recently, the charging method is via Micro USB. This is an old connection method for 2019 and I fell should be USB-C. All our mobile devices at home are USB-C so now it means taking two cables when we go on a trip.

Connection via Bluetooth was easy and quick. Once connected, they stayed connected.

Sound quality if really good - as is to be expected in this price bracket, with nice clear highs and solid low end response. Noise cancellation is the best I've had on any cans to date.
