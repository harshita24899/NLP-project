4.0 out of 5 stars,"Update sept 26

Got the replacement set and they sound do much better than the first ones I recieved. This kind of issues is unheard of from a product that costs 30k not gonna lie. Seriosuly? A defective pair of headphones ? Unexpected sony !

Update- sept-25

So I was using these like.usual when I started hearing a shrill noise from the right side earcup! Tried it with multiple devices , persistsnt shrill noise with noise cancelion and no music( my room's fan was off ) . Replacing for a new pair . Will update

I'm not a ""audiophile"" but I've tested and heard many headphones/earphones in search of the ""perfect"" pair of cans for me. Perfect is a subjective term and will vary from person to person.

I bought these becasue of all the hype with the xm3's and as a customer the ""next"" version would obviously be better right ?

So, come delivery day. I ooened these, set them up, updated the firmware and started listening . These sound , ok. For something that costs 30k, these sound average at best. The noice cancelling is good but I need to test it more , possibly on an airplane ( whenever that happens )

When something is this expensive you automatically have some expectations from it right ? It has to perform at the 30k level ( I hope the reader is getting what I'm trying to say) .

The software features are great , the build feels premium, the connection is strong.

P.S if you intend to use the multipoint function you will loose audio quality . LDAC uses two lanes ( max for bluetooth 5.0) and when you use multipoint it switches to SBC ( 1 lane ) so expect quality loss. Windows doesn't support LDAC so you will loose significant quality when connected to a pc.

I'll update the review after the burn in period . I won't be returning these since these are just too damn comfortable but doesn't justify the 30k price tag it demands for the sound quality I'm getting as of 20 sept.",Reviewed in India on 20 September 2020,"As someone else in this review section said "" conditionally recommend"""
4.0 out of 5 stars,"After a very slow delivery by Amazon, it came in a secure package. Looks bulky but premium. Just press power button for 7 sec to see connect it to a new device.

Sound: Excellent, bass heavy.
Built quality: Looks study so far. Very comfortable on ears even with spectacles. I have been using it for 2 hrs straight and I can hardly feel anything on my head or ears.
ANC: Although there is a stark difference when you hear things with active noise cancellation but still it is not perfect. I bought it because my study room is close to kitchen but alas I still hear utensils.

Will update this review with time.

Update 1: I have to admit sounds really great. Since it is base heavy, even at 50% volume, you get a theatre experience (no kidding).

Update 2: ANC is not that great. Sitting in my room I can hear people talking next to me (cannot make what they are saying) while it does kills all the noises of fan.",Reviewed in India on 28 September 2020,Not that great for the price
5.0 out of 5 stars,"This is a great piece of headphone.

Reason for purchase :- I'm a bass lover and owning Sony MDR XB-950 (Extra Bass) headphone, but needed a noice cancellation headhone with equivalent kind of audio quality. I tried Bose QC-35 (almost the same price) but i didn't like audio output there, bass was too much suppressed but noise cancellation was good. So Bose QC-35 didn't felt like worth the price. I checked for somthing from Sony and found this new model WH-1000XM4, looks for some reviews in youtube and went for it. Below is my observation on this headphone.

Sound Quality :- Excellent using via IPhone 10 plus on apps amazon music, gaana although youtube video sound quality was not good.

Noise Cancellation :- Feels like no one is around. Lots of interior work/construction going on my building but after wearing this woooo, all goes off. Will try this when my wife will start talking could be a life saviour :p

Comfort and build :- comfort is good wearing this for straight 4 hour , no pain or anything.

Sony app is good and this headphone comes with lots of feature and available with just a touch.

5.0 out of 5 stars,"So much is already said about these headphones, I am only going to vouch for the praise they're getting. Great noise cancelation, superb audio quality, reliable battery life and study build. They have a good lineage advantage too. My only complaints are that, they tend to make you sweat along the ear cups, slight issues with the microphone quality on calls made outdoors, no official water resistance specifications and although they support gestures for audio control, lack of physical buttons or rotary dials make them unreliable in certain conditions like snow.

But, those are just nitpicking. Must have for ANC. They definitely give Bose run for their money.

P. S. To connect with multiple devices use the Sony Headphones App, go to settings and enable support for two simultaneous devices.",Reviewed in India on 27 September 2020,Best of two worlds

3.0 out of 5 stars,"*Only buy this for noise cancellation and multi point connection*

The Audio quality is below average.
But the built quality and comfort is next level. And with all these features it's better than any other wireless headphones. But audio quality doesn't justify this price. While calling it drops to low quality on sbc codec which is worst. But the microphone is better in this. I will be using this only while Traveling and in office. If you need a good audio setup get a Open Back headphone and a DAC.

Again, recommend only for those who need noise cancellation.",Reviewed in India on 25 September 2020,Had high expectations but got disappointed.
4.0 out of 5 stars,"Delivers very high on the Noise Cancellation.
But if you also intend to use this for making Skype / Zoom calls, then i would ask you to skip this product.
The microphone picks up all background noise and people speaking in the background also. The one listening to you is going to get a lot of disturbance. I did not see any way to tweak the mic configurations via the app.
I dont know if this is a a Firmware issue and would be fixed in the updated versions or a HW limitation.

Verdict: If you are not going to use the Mic for any meetings etc then i would suggest to grab this product. But not if you are going to use it for meetings.",Reviewed in India on 22 September 2020,Excellent ANC but poor Mic Quality
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought the much hyped 1000xm4 after a lot of online research. My expectations were much high. But when i tried them for the first time i was pretty disappointed. I was at the verge of returning them. But i started to like them in same day after a couple of songs. Gradually i realized the issue was with the songs i heard, which was of 128kbps bit rate. Then i tried these on with some hd songs. It was just amazing. Now i love these cans.Noise cancelation is solid. Bass is tight with nice timbre but the low bass is not that great for my likening. Everything else is as great as it can get.My advice: never judge its sound quality with low resolution songs from youtube and all. Try atleast 320kbps songs.",Reviewed in India on 25 September 2020,Technology at its best

5.0 out of 5 stars,"This is my first noise-cancelling headphones & below is my experience after 24 hours of usage.

1. Noise-cancelling - It will take you to another dimension if this your first NC headphones. It cancels out 90% of the ambient noise around you. It doesn't cancel all high-frequency sounds. Don't get me wrong here, this is expected from any NC headphones in the market & XM4 is undoubtedly one of the best NC flagships.

2. Sound quality - I have been listening to music continuously & also watched a few episodes of Stranger things. It sounds quite bright, great soundstage & the audio can be adjusted using the equalizer in the companion app. Bass is punchy, definitely not overpowering & the effect makes the experience super-immersive. LDAC works with Android phones. But LDAC is not available with multipoint Bluetooth connections.

3. Comfort - This is one aspect where I'm very picky. As soon as you put these on, it feels like plush cushions over your ears. It is very comfortable & doesn't make me take it off before a couple of hours. After 3+ hours of continuous usage, one will feel some heat around the ears, which is normal if you ask me.

4. Multipoint connection - I find it seamless in this aspect. I'm connected to my laptop & phone simultaneously, it almost instantly switches between devices playing audio.

5. Microphone quality - Honestly, it's okay. If one's planning to buy this only for taking calls, then consider Bose's NC offerings. XM4s are okay for normal day to day calls, the other party can hear little noise, and NC is turned off as soon as a call is started. Call quality is better in cellular & degrades if done through Social apps like WhatsApp.

Conclusion - It is a wonderful experience if one's looking for a flagship headphone with average microphone quality. Sony has left no stones unturned & this is arguably one of Sony's best creations. If spending 30k on a headphone doesn't break the bank or hurts you in any way, then this should be one's best pick in the 30k bracket.",Reviewed in India on 3 October 2020,Best NC cans one can get in 2020
4.0 out of 5 stars,"There is no much improvement in terms of audio quality and noise cancellation. Audio quality is (excellent no doubt) but marginally better than XM3s. Noise cancellation is good and cancels out high and mid tones but low tones are still audible which can be irritating sometimes (My Airpods pro cancel these out). Only feature that is really useful is the multi device connectivity. Most of the ""Adaptive Sound Features"" are gimmicky. This is a good device no doubt but the price difference of almost 6k isn't justified. Wait for few days for the price to drop. I rushed and bought it just few mins after the India launch at a retail store which was a mistake...",Reviewed in India on 27 September 2020,Excellent headphones but wait for the price drop...
3.0 out of 5 stars,Light weight and very comfortable headphones. This is my first noise cancellation headphones and I am impressed with technology. This headphones sounds great too.

,"Not 1 millisecond, 1 full second... it could even be more. For a $500 pair of headphones you'd think they'd be able to adjust this latency, or fix it with a software patch.

I've gone into the Sony headphone app and even set the headphones to (priority on connection) instead of the audio quality setting, and the Bluetooth connection still has a full second audio lag while watching a movie on my Samsung 4k tv. This is incredibly frustrating as you see people's lips moving but don't hear them speak.

So far I haven't found a way to adjust the latency.

I'll update this part of my review if Sony solves this issue.

The noise cancelling is amazing, the battery life is amazing, the quick charge is amazing, the ability to connect multiple devices is amazing. They're very light weight and incredibly comfortable. If they solve the horrible latency issue, I'll give these a 5 star rating.",Reviewed in Canada on 24 August 2020,
,"I have owned the Bose QC 35 series I (the originals) for four years now, and just recently replaced the ear pads since they finally deteriorated. I figured after four years there has to be some serious improvements in noise cancelling technology, and since the WH-1000XM3 model got so many good reviews I figured these would be awesome. So I pre-ordered them.

I pulled them out of the box and followed the very quick connect process of downloading the app and using it to pair to my phone. It downloaded a firmware update automatically while I fiddled around with some settings briefly and listened to some music. Super easy, awesome.

The sound is very impressive. Punchy kick drum (I listen mostly to rock/metal) and nice bright sound. I quickly settled on a slightly customized version of the included Bright preset.

But things quickly went downhill from there.

After using the headphones for a bit, the touch controls became frankly annoying and easily susceptible to mistakes (I triggered track skips multiple times just by removing and putting the headphones back on). The volume adjustment is especially tedious...if you want to raise or lower the volume significantly you have to swipe it up or down a large number of times because the volume adjustment is done in small increments. With the Bose QC 35 and its dedicated buttons, you just quickly push the buttons. Simple.

I spent about 20 minutes trying to figure out how to pair the headphones with my laptop, reading the guide in the app and doing some web searching, thinking it must be provided by one of the two dedicated buttons like on the Bose QE 35s. Nope. It must be done with the app. In fact, everything has to be done with the app except whatever you have the custom button configured to do, and the power. On the Bose I just have to slide the power button, and it goes into pairing mode. Simple.

The above are honestly smaller issues that you could probably put up with since the sound these produce is so good. However, the deal breaker for me was when I connected them with the included wire to the controller on my Roku Ultra to enjoy some TV time after a long day. I always watch movies and TV with headphones. To my horror they produced a clearly audible hissing sound that is incredibly distracting. I turned them off and on again, disconnected and reconnected the cable. No change, still the hissing sound. My Bose don't produce this sound. Ugh.

After listening to them for a couple hours I had a slight headache and felt fatigued, almost nauseous. I know some people are affected differently by the noise cancelling technology, but I don't get this from my Bose, even after listening to them all day.

Additionally, speaking of noise cancelling, I compared my Bose QC 35s to these, and I couldn't tell the difference between the noise cancelling. They sound the same to me. :shrug: I'm sure you could tell the difference with laboratory equipment though.

All-in-all the sound these produce is really good, and the noise cancelling is great (although I can't tell the difference from my Bose QC 35 Series I). But they have 1) lots of annoyances in the touch controls instead of dedicated buttons, 2) the fact that the app is required to do everything (including pairing) except turning them off and activating the custom button, 3) the hissing on the wired connection to my Roku Ultra, and 4) the fatiguing after listening to them.

I'll be returning them.",Reviewed in the United States on 21 August 2020,
,"Noise cancellation and audio quality are top notch. The bass is nice, clean, and punchy and the rest is pretty good for Bluetooth headphones.

The issues I had and prompted a return for these cans is the mic quality and the touch controls. Pairing them with my desktop and laptops resulted in poor mic quality so Teams/Skype and discord are not usable since it uses a lower quality codec (AptX is GONE in the xm4's and the 3.5mm cable disables the mic). The touch controls aren't customizable so long scroll or short scroll for volume does not change the amount so it's tedious, and if you do it too quickly it skips songs or pauses.

If you have no use for the mic and want good sounding Bluetooth headphones, these are them. If Sony fixed the mic issues from the WH-1000XM3 these would be almost perfect.",Reviewed in Canada on 23 August 2020,
,"These don't cancel out the pitch that I constantly hear in my office, and almost amplifies that pitch. Besides not being able to cancel out high frequency noises and pitches, they're great, but not for my purpose (in my office). If you're the type of person who can hear a lot of low/high frequency sounds, like from kitchen appliances being plugged in, or you can hear that annoying pitch that others do not in your office or home, these won't solve the issue. But if you've been blessed with average ears, you'll be fine and love these.",Reviewed in Canada on 21 August 2020,
,"They are comfortable, sound good and that's it. there's your $500. the rest sucks. I expected better noise cancellation from a $500 headphone. Noise cancellation does everything but block stupid people laughing and talking besides me. thus, need to pump up the volume and possibly hurt my ears. I really regret my purchase after all the hype around these. reviews everywhere said they were the best. In my opinion, they are no better than my kids 50$ headphones. Yes, the sound is good. but I constantly hear this white noise in my ears. If i turn of noise cancellation, I hear people around me even loader than without headphones. it's really unpleasant. Seems Sony WANTS you to hear other people’s conversations. I get that sometimes on the move, near a street, you need to hear but then again, if I choose not too, that should be my choice.So my advice is do not by just because of the noise cancellation cause it’s not what it is. It does not cancel sound. It blocks certain noises but these noises when listening to music would not bother anyhow. Voices however need to be blocked out but are not. I actually even use then in the house for fun when I want to ease drop on my kids phone conversations when they are in their room. I hear them better with the headphone on as it amplifies other people’s voices. Great job on noise cancellation Sony!",Reviewed in Canada on 5 September 2020,
,"Just sitting outside a busy factory downtown city on a park bench. I pull out these slick soft headphones and once i power it on. Well just silence, like your in your own world. I got chills since I've never had noise cancelling headphones.These headphones sound absolutely fantastic. Installing the app on my phone and changed the EQ to excite mode. The bass is not in your face but if you like the rumble low end movie like bass than you will want these. Not to say these headphones can get much more bass if your into that thing.

,"If you are looking for noise cancelation at its best, don't look elsewhere and buy this immediately.

Of all the comments that have been said about being not enough this, not able to do that, I think they are all untrue or either an unlucky manufacturing defect. Launch products are not perfect from the start, it's bound to happen. The only thing I do not use are the microphones for making calls, so you can check online and see for yourself about that aspect.

Let's break this down in points. (TLDR at the bottom)

Comfort/Ergonomics:

Without a doubt the most comfortable headphones I ever wore. People seem to complain that it's not as comfortable as the XM3s, I say it's pretty dang comfortable considering that I wore this thing for more than 5 hours straight and had no neck pain or itching whatsoever.

The weight of these headphones is so light that when the box came in, I thought I had been scammed and the headphones weren't in the box. 250 ish grams is really light (0.55 pounds) for headphones.

The ears are big enough, the line of the muffs doesn't overlap too much towards the neck and the cushion material adapts really well to your head, both on the top of the frame and on the ear muffs.

Sound/frequency response:

I have been mixing/mastering for multiple years on flat studio monitors. Out of all the headphones that I have or I have tried, these are the closest of being pretty much flat, once you cut 3-4 dB from the 400 Hz fader (pretty sure it's an octave bandwidth, or a little more, so it covers at least from 282 Hz to 566 Hz when you adjust it) on the equalizer in Sony's Headphones app.

I have attached the frequency response curve as an image in this review.

The bass is not overwhelming, (although if it's your style, it delivers with the clear bass knob, which probably covers 250 Hz and below), the highs are not too sharp and there's no spike in the high mids (2500-5000 Hz) or in the high end (above 5000 Hz).

The only problem is the low mids at around 400 Hz, which thank god they have a fader for that frequency. No matter what brand you choose, low mids are ALWAYS a problem in headphones. By the way, sound separation is excellent once I made that adjustment. Thank Sony for giving you the option!

The frequency response when using Bluetooth is between 15 Hz to 17 040 Hz. Beyond that, it starts to wane off. I have up to 19.1 kHz in my right ear and 18.3-18.4 kHz in my left ear, so it's not on my side. Considering that my phone has a terrible audio output (it cuts at 15 kHz), it's an upgrade for me.

Also, considering on how many people listen to their music too loud for the last 25 years, I would be highly surprised that people that claim the high end isn't well defined actually know what they are talking about, and most probably don't notice the difference. Same thing with audio CODECS disappearing from the XM3 (the XM4 has 3 and the XM3 had 5), above 256 kbps at variable rate and 320 kbps at constant bit rate, you don't notice anything if the conversion was done right. Above those values, me and my friend call this ""Placebo Quality"". Compression and brickwalled mixes affect the quality perception GREATLY.

Search NPR sound quality test online. It proves my point.

So in conclusion, if the song you are listening sounds like garbage, it's because it was mixed/mastered like garbage (probably mixed nowadays because they brickwall often at this stage). These are hands down the best headphones I ever tried. Period. Including my Sennheisers that I used for multiple years.

Noise cancelation:

I was highly surprised at not only the sensation on your eardrum being pushed in not being super apparent compared to other models, which are quite frankly unbearable in the long run, but also the capabilities of phase canceling of these headphones (the actual term of canceling out waveforms is called phase canceling, noise canceling is a marketing term for people not familiar with audio, since the majority of people don't know what is phase).

Transients (such as impacts) are impossible to isolate because they are too fast to sample and to invert the phase to create cancelation. Steady noises are the only ones that allow the headphones to sample them and invert them, because there's a processing delay. Stop hitting a table like someone I know was doing to test headphones, it's worthless.

The amount that is being canceled out is out of this world compared to previous generations that I have tried. I can't wait to try them on a plane. High end will remain because it's the most difficult part of the waveform to cancel, since it's the most precise and the one that takes up the most information in a signal. I was standing next to a washing machine during its max spin cycle, could barely hear it with audio of people talking in my headphones. Without playback, you hear the high end when you're right in front of it. As soon as you close the door, it pretty much vanishes.

If you have noisy neighbors or live in an apartment, buy this thing! You won't regret it.

Battery life: Outlasts my cell phone by a hundred years. In 2 hours of use, not even 10% used. Specs are believable.

In conclusion, buy this thing if you are looking for noise canceling!

TLDR:
-Super comfortable
-Amazing in sound
-Amazing in noise canceling and battery life matching specs",Reviewed in Canada on 30 September 2020,
,"The touch control on my headphone stopped working, and I thought I received a bad unit. But later I figured out it was the wear detection. I wear the headphone with a skull cap, and the wear sensor doesn't work well with it. It thinks I'm not wearing it, so it automatically shuts down after a while and disables touch control. Without a cap, it works flawlessly, with the cap on, I have to disable Auto Shut-off in the app to make everything work.Besides that problem, it's an amazing headphone. It cancels more noise, is more comfortable, even multipoint support works better compared to Surface Headphones 2.

,"I own both the XM3 and XM4 no perceivable difference between them. I would not recommend you spend the extra money on XM4, XM3 are as good. However, as much as weight is tolerable, the earmuffs are not comfortable. I have not the biggest ears but they are not the small ones that you barely can see. I wonder why would any engineer designing the headphones not realized one simple idea. We all have different sizes of ears, so design extension so people who need more space for the ears can enjoy these headphones as much as the ones that have smaller ones.If your ears are average, you will suffer from heat and sweat. Now, I have been wearing them all day long, only because I have inserts made from foam that create enough space to decrease the discomfort of components and inside foam pressing against your earlobes. The noise cancelling is just amazing and it allows me to focus on studies or work The quality of sound is great, what is missing is the ergonomics.

,"I wanted to replace my old Bose in-ear noise cancelling headphones with something more comfortable and that works better. I spent hours reading reviews, and settlled on the Sony WH-1000XM4.

When I received it, I was amazed how good everything sounded through them, and how well the noise cancelling worked. And they were comfortable to boot!

However, the next day I did my first Zoom call, and a colleague told me that I sounded like I was in a tunnel, and that he couldn't make out what I was saying. I switched to my old Bose set, and everything was fine.

That evening, i called Sony support. I spent about 30 minutes on the phone with the very nice support person, including making calls from my phone vs my computer, resetting the headphones, etc, etc. It didn't help. He denied that he had heard of microphone problems before. He asked that I send the headphones to Sony for a replacement, thinking that they were a lemon, but I told him I'd rather just return them to Amazon. Which I did. requesting an identical replacement.

A day later I had the new ones. And there was the same problem of poor mic quality, with weird static-like sounds and muffling. At this point, I decided to solve the problem. I tried the following, using recordings of Zoom calls to monitor the quality:

1) Single vs dual bluetooth connectivity.
2) Different microphone volume settings.
3) Different degrees of noise cancellation (including none at all).
And probably a couple that I am forgetting.

Nothing helped the poor mic quality. I then really searched the web, and found out that although there are plenty of wonderful reviews, hidden in the reviews where the mic is used are clear examples of problems with the microphone.

I then called Amazon to request another return, but used the microphone from the headphones, and then switched to my phone. The representative could hear the difference easily, and said she had trouble understanding me when I used the headphones.

So I am giving up, and will buy a different brand. I am writing this long review to spare my fellow Amazonites who need to use a microphone the pain of having to return items.",Reviewed in Canada on 7 September 2020,
,"The noise cancellation on this thing truly has to be experienced to be believed! It completely and thoroughly blocks out almost all background noise, resulting in near-total silence even with no music playing on it.I see there are mixed opinions about the touch controls on the internet but I found them to be quite OK once I got used to them. I had no problems with pairing etc either.  Comfort-wise, I was able to wear the device for 4-5 hours at a stretch,  and did not feel a clamping sensation or my ears getting warm. I did get some mild tinnitus though (despite never exceeding 50% volume) but maybe that's just me, considering no one else has mentioned it.The sound quality, however, was a real sore point for me, considering all the hype. It was, IMO, good on Apple devices, and just OK on Android (even with LDAC on). But (and this is why I decided to return it) it was just downright terrible on Windows 10. It actually sounded worse than my $150 QY8 IEM on Windows, plus the touch controls like Forward/Next/Pause did not work. I was aware that there's no AptX support before purchase, but assumed other enhancements like DSEE would compensate for the quality loss caused by SBC on Windows. Not the case unfortunately. Using it wired does improve the quality on Windows very slightly, but not enough to justify the CA$550 price tag or the extreme hype.",Reviewed in Canada on 3 September 2020,

I had to always skip songs or adjust volume directly on my phone. These are ok headphones but not worth $500.",Reviewed in Canada on 30 September 2020,

,"Download Sony Headphone Connect App, open box, turn on headphones (bottom of left headphone on/off switch), using Sony Connect App, connect and paired new headphones.
- My headphones were 100% charged out of box.
- Many features in Sony Connect App, matter of your preference and use. I do think the app is solid and useful for my use of these headphones.
- My headphones firmware updated automatically -be patient, process took several minutes. Initial impression; very comfortable, really good noise canceling and sound quality.
- Voice clarity on both ends is outstanding.
- Easily connected two iPhones, my experience switching between them was seamless.
- Used ear profile in-app feature to analyze my ear shape for 360 Reality Audio setup.
- Able to connect to MacBook Pro (2020 version) directly via Bluetooth with no issues.

UPDATE: >30 hours of iPhone X, 8, and Bluetooth MacBook Pro connection.
- The phone call quality is awesome (you can hear
- No video lag/latency on FT and Zoom calls.
- I have found the connection at times can be a bit cumbersome when having two devices connected and receiving calls, it might be a setting or how I am picking up the call --directly from the phone or double-tapping on the headset.
- Great noise suppression to the wind, outside city/road-noise, etc... No reported issues with other people on calls with me. Always told call quality was very crisp and clear... my experience, much better than Apple Airpod Pro for suppression of noise for callers on the other end.
- I have also now used these headphones for Bluetooth connection to Nvidia Shield connected to my TV for over 16 hrs. Easy direct connection directly from Nvidia Bluetooth Settings. TV and Movie surround sound is great, you can hear the slightest sounds.

Bose 700 vs. Sony WH-1000XM4
- Seamless connection - prefer SONY
- Comfort - prefer Sony
- Headphone sound controls - prefer Bose. Sony touch control works ok but the Bose increase/decrease volume seems to work better on Sony
- Noise-canceling for me, both performed in a similar way
- Call quality, for me, both performed in a similar way

,"Just got my new XM4 yesterday. Did a full charge and downloaded the app. The sound isn't as good as I had hoped. I'm comparing then to my Bose QC 35. The controls are very awkward but I guess I need some time to adjust. The part I don't like is the technology aspect of these headphones. There are several settings to go thru to establish the proper noise cancelling, including location and sending pics of your ears to Sony. Of course I didn't upload any pics, and after lots of quirks, I turned off location. There is a setting that auto mutes the headphone when you speak, so if you intend to sing along with your music, it mutes. You can't even clear your throat or sneeze, otherwise it mutes. How annoying.. bottom line I turned all the technology off which makes them regular headphones. The sound is great when  playing music, but call quality is mediocre compared to Bose. In the app, you can change the equilizer presets a however, several are identical which is dumb. You can set a custom EQ setting. I'm considering returning them, but I will give a few more days for me to adjust and see if it gets better.One solid point I forgot to mention. The new Sonys have Bluetooth 5.0 where as Bose QC35 have 4.1 or 4.2 (depending on when you bought them). The Bose connection is not very stable. The receiving antenna is on the right side of Bose QC, and if my phone were on my left hip, it cuts it or jitters. The Sony's are absolutely solid, and with 5.0, you can literally walk around the house without your phone and it hasn't stuttered once.Update 8/25/2020: After a couple more hours tinkering with them, the voice assist is horrible, and the worst part, the headphones do NOT announce caller. (Bose do).. I haven't found a solid way to reject a call and it isn't in the help section. While the controls take practice, most of the time I try adjusting the volume, but change the track instead.  I definitely prefer the buttons on the Bose as its really easy and intuitive.",Reviewed in the United States on 23 August 2020,

It performs well, although I prefer my B&O H9 with one exception.

,"As of about three years ago, I was an earbuds guy. The wireless over-hear headphones I had tried previously never could approximate the kind of audio immersion you get when you wedge little speakers directly into your ear canals. I never found over-hear headphone noise cancellation to work that well - often, turning it on would create more noise than it cancelled, compromising audio quality and, well, just sucking generally. Not to mention the inconsistent and typically non-intuitive affordances for powering on/off, pairing, and controlling playback on these things.

But then I picked up a pair of Sony's WH-H900N noise cancelling wireless headphones. I basically fell in love with them on day one and used the heck out of them over the past 3 years. So, now I'm an over-ear headphones guy. Specifically, THIS line of over-ear headphones that Sony is putting out.

I still love my H900Ns. But we all know that in tech a lot can change in 3 years time. In fact, I was about to upgrade to the WH-1000XM3s a few months ago but held off after learning about the imminent release of the M4s. So I waited. Then I pre-ordered. Yesterday, I received them.

I've now had about 24 hours to toy around with them and I'm already prepared to say that these are clearly the best headphones I've ever owned. Which is to say: They're everything I love about my WH-900Ns, but better:

- They're noticeably lighter, and based on about 5 hours of use I'm convinced they're more comfortable to wear
- Sound quality is significantly better. I didn't actually expect this amount of improvement, but it's definitely noticeable at both low and high end. Separation of layers is particularly amazing: vocals shine with total clarity, heavy bass tracks shake and vibrate my skull without any noticeable distortion; high-hats and snares are crisp and clear. Very happy with this so far, which i should mention is just using the default settings with songs downloaded from Spotify. I'm looking forward to optimizing further with custom equalizer settings in the sound connect app.
- Small thing but the semi-hardshell case with dedicated accessory storage (pictured) is really nice to have (900Ns just came with a bag...)
- Clarity of phone calls - both input and output (i.e., the mic works well) - is excellent. This is key as I plan to use these to listen to music and take meetings while WFH for the foreseeable future. The 900Ns were also very good in this regard, but the ability to connect to both my work computer and my mobile device simultaneously will really help me out during the work week.

CONNECTING TO TWO DEVICES SIMULTANEOUSLY

One of the issues is figuring out how to connect to these things to two devices at the same time. Given that this is a new and much-anticipated feature, I would have thought Sony would have thought to make it crystal clear to new users how to actually do this. Maybe I missed it, but I couldn't find instructions for how to do this. Here are the steps I discovered through trial and error that allowed me to simultaneously connect to both my iPhone and Mac Mini:

1. You may have to enable the feature from within the Headphones mobile app. For me, it was disabled. See photo I uploaded showing the relevant part of the application.
2. You need to first pair the headphones to each device separately before it is possible to connect to them simultaneously. As far as I can tell, there is no way to put the headphones in pairing mode when they're connected to a device.
3. Then, when the headphones are connected to one of the devices, you should be able to connect your second device to the headphones using the second device's bluetooth preferences.
4. If the second device successfully connects, you'll hear a voice notification through the headphones: ""Bluetooth device 2 connected"". You'll also see two devices listed under the ""Status"" tab of the Headphones Connect application.

Not a big deal, but seems silly that something like the above wasn't just in Sony's own documentation.

OTHER MINOR GRIEVANCES AND NITPICKS

It seems that the only way to get the most out of these is to use them with your Android or iOS device. This is because a lot of functionality - such as the ability to customize sound - is only available on iOS/Android devices with the Sony Headphones Connect application. The iOS app is decidedly intended for use on iPhones - it only runs in portrait orientation, making it a pain to use on my iPad (which I almost always use in landscape orientation). But the worst thing about this is that I can't customize anything when listening on a MacOS device, which these days is a lot of the time. Fortunately, these sound excellent even with the default settings - just wish the capabilities of these headphones wasn't dependent on which device I was using them with.

Final minor grievance (for now) is this adaptive sound control feature that Sony got me to try out. It requires location sharing and by default fires annoying and surprisingly frequent notifications on my iPhone about how it's apparently adapting to my ambient environment. I figured out how to mute the notifications but still need to figure out how to shut the feature off entirely, which I frankly have had enough of. My advice is to opt out of this feature when you first set your headphones up. Very disruptive with totally unclear benefits.

FINAL WORD (FOR NOW)

,"Sony WH-1000XM4 Wireless Industry Leading Noise Canceling Overhead Headphones with Mic for phone.

PROS :
1) Best noise cancelling on the current market Period in all frequencies.
2) Sound quality incredibly balanced & adjustable with the App to individual taste
3) Exceptionally comfortable, only beaten by the Bose 35s
4) Excellent connectivity stable connection with 2 devices at once
5) 30 hours battery life

CONS:
1) No AptX LL. This is a reason for me to send them back since I watch movies with head phones. In this day & age we need low latency to watch video content.
This is unforgivable since Sony was notified in their previous version the WH-1000XM3 it was a must.
2) Wind turns the ambient sound feature on & off. This is beyond annoying. Thank goodness it can be turned off
3) If it's windy one can hear wind in a phone conversation. This is not a problem with the Bose 700s
4) The ears will get quite warm if the headphones are worn for long periods.
5) I'm still not a fan of the swipe controls. They can be glitchy. For instance when trying to turn volume up or down, sometimes it pauses the music & other times it switches to the next track.

Overall Sony has improved the WH-1000XM4 from the previous generation but it could be better, much better with a few tweaks & recommendations above to become the ultimate noise cancelling bluetooth headphones on the market.

****EDIT**** I had to send the unit back because the automatic quick attention mode where human voices turn the music off went hay wire. Every sound started to turn the unit off. It didn't matter in the app if that feature was on or off, it kept doing it. This is a major flaw in the design. I DO NOT RECOMMEND this model.

,"Okay, first of all, I'm not Rich, my part-time requires to be on Video Call 20hrs/week, and Earphones just hurt.
I needed something comfortable and safe for my ears.

I did extensive research on what Headphones I should buy and I'm pretty sure that's what you're doing.

I'll sum up my Experience, and Cons!

Here's my experience with WH-1000XM4:
1. Immense Control on Ambient Sound/ Noise Cancellation
2. Add-on feature to Focus-on-Voice so you don't hear noises just voices
3. There's a speak-to-chat function also ( when you speak it pauses the music) => it's not mentioned anywhere but there's a shortcut to enable it, use 2 fingertips and keep it on the control.
4. Noise Cancellation is OMG just amazing. It works by 180-degree phase-shifting the environment noises + sealing of the noise.
5. The BASS, if anyone tells you they don't have bass, just set the 'Clear Bass' in App to '10', it's amazing.
6. Music is crystal-clear, low volume to max volume, no distortion!
7. I am on Zoom calls for nearly 6 hours every day and the microphone picks it up clearly
8. It also filters out disturbances in the background, people won't know where you are (haha)
9. Long hours no worries, it's very comfy and light-weight
10. Quick-Charge is probably the most underrated feature. There's no stopping the music yesss!
11. The travel bag is pretty solid also!
12. It connects with 2-device finally
13. The touch controls are really good, I was afraid of making random gestures but that doesn't happen much.
14. It automatically pauses music when you take it off and turns it on when you put it back on (you can disable this also)
15. Connect with the phone and listen to music on the laptop, it automatically pauses music/video/youtube if you get a call.
16. The quick-attention mode is pretty handy for 5 to 10-sec chats
17. It optimizes the NC according to the pressure, WOW, you'll see the difference if you travel
18. It detects whether you'rs standing, sitting, walking, or jogging and you can change the ambient sound based on it - very handy if you go on walks with your headphones.

Cons:
1. The switching between 2 devices takes up to 1-2 secs unless it's a call so that's really fast.
2. The assistant doesn't reply back if you're listening to music and use that (probably my phone is old that's why)

Yup, that's all - I LOVE THESE. GO FOR IT, you'll not regret it.

,"I had the 1000XM3, which unfortunately broke when the headband snapped. That fragility, along with the poor voice call quality, made me slightly resentful of the price I paid for them. Sony was great enough to replace it with a new one, which I decided to resell and use part of proceeds to upgrade to these guys.

So far these work great! I'm still concerned about the durability, but I'll also only be using these guys for walks and runs around the city for the foreseeable future. Hopefully, that mitigates the risk of damage.

Sound quality is still great, I'd like to do a side by side test to gauge the difference of the DSEE modes, but I've left it on without an issue. The noise cancellation is terrific, and finally, voice calls are functional (I'm pretty sure it denoises the other caller as well, which means their phone's denoising is mixed in with Sony's. The result is usable, but not crisp and full-bodied sound like I'd like. But they're voice calls so I'll take what I can get.

I'll always recommend these to folks, though not necessarily over the Bose alternatives since I haven't heard those myself.

These are terrific all-around, and for someone who wants to chat handless on a call, this finally pushes the 1000XM series into a must-have.",Reviewed in the United States on 21 August 2020,
,"I have never spent more than $70 on a pair of headphones, so Sony's new XM4 Headphones was a large purchase for me.

To give you some context, my main headphones have been the Sony MDR7506 Large Diaphragm Headphones.
They've been awesome for delivering balanced sound, creating music and using for my laptop when I'm stationary, but they've never been the best type of headphones to bring with me when I'm on the go or traveling.

I've had these headphones for 3 days now, and while I expect more updates in the future via the Sony Headphones app, I've been pleasantly surprised to find how comfortable they are and convenient to use when I'm walking around or simply relaxing in my room.

Compared to my previous headphones, if I wore them longer than a couple of hours, my ears and sides of my head would hurt. As a glasses wearer, I was concerned that these headphones would do the same, but they've been awesome so far - I've worn them for 6 hours straight with no ear pain! :)

I prefer turning off the Ambient filter setting in the app while I'm at home, since I like to hear what's around me, but once I start traveling again, I'd imagine I'd use it more. The noise-cancelling definitely works, even without the headphones turned on - I almost find it disorienting how quiet everything becomes when I turn the headphones on (I'm used to a lot of background noises in my daily life).

In terms of sound quality, I can't say I was amazed. This mostly is because I think I already had a pretty great pair of headphones to begin with, and now with the XM4's I can hear details a bit more thanks to the noise canceling! I haven't experimented much with the equalizer yet within the app, but that's something I would like to update people on as I continue to use them.

The only disappointment I have so far with them is the incapability I have with pairing them with my main PC.
I checked to make sure my drivers were updated and the headphones themselves, but they seem to have a hard time being detected at all, or they are paired as an ""other device"" on my Windows 10 PC. This could be due to my own doing, as I built the PC myself, and perhaps there is a problem, but nonetheless, I tried to find a solution online but couldn't find one...so I have resorted to using them plugged in, which is a tad disappointing, but I do realize these headphones are more meant for on-the-go then plug and play.

Considering this is my first time buying expensive headphones, I want to be honest - I think I may have been better off buying cheaper ones, but at the same time, they do deliver what they said they would - the speak to chat feature is extremely helpful when I'm busy or my hands are full and can't actively touch my phone or headphones (the music or whatever you're listening to is paused and outside voices are amplified so you can hear what you and others are saying). This feature can be disabled in the app, and set to different times in terms of when to turn off. EX: I was speaking to my mom when I was doing the dishes, and I couldn't quite take them off when my hands were wet - music was paused and I could hear what she was saying! :D

I'll probably update this as I start using them more when I'm outside the house.

I hope this helps you decide if you would like to purchase these headphones.
Stay safe out there!",Reviewed in the United States on 22 August 2020,
,"I spent both a live chat session and SIX phone calls with Sony customer support trying to get these to work properly, to no avail. This is one of the most disappointing purchases I've made recently. Arguably the biggest selling point of the XM4 over the XM3 headphones is the multi-device connection feature, which supposedly lets you switch automatically between two devices. Without this feature, you may as well buy the XM3 headphones for $100-$150 less. It doesn't work when paired with MacBook Pro and iPhone. I've tried everything — restoring the headphones to default settings, deleting and reinstalling the app, deregistering and re-registering the headphones from both devices — nothing works. Search the Sony subreddit and you'll find a bunch of posts with the exact same problem when using a Mac and iPhone with this feature. The headphones will not switch connection to the second device. Both my MacBook and iPhone are running the latest versions of their respective OS. The MacBook is a 16"" model from 2016 and the iPhone is an XS.It seems completely nuts to me that Sony didn't detect this issue before putting these on the market. After six support phone calls and a live chat session, Sony did not offer to replace my unit. They told me the problem was with my computer and if I would like to return the headphones, I could. It would be one thing if the headphones had a compatibility warning that says ""Does not work with MacBook Pros"" or something, but there is no such warning. So if you use a Mac and an iPhone and you're thinking about getting these, please realize you may find yourself spending many futile hours trying to get this feature to work. If you don't care about that feature, I'm sure they're a great buy. The sound quality is great and the noise cancelling is excellent. Just pick up a pair of XM3 headphones instead and save yourself a chunk of cash.",Reviewed in the United States on 28 August 2020,
,"First impressions. Easy to setup and firmware update guck and easy. Initially not impressed with noise cancellation as hearing a lot of ambient background noise. I’m finding the settings in Sony’s headphone connect app aren’t intuitive, at least for me.I expected heat to be an issue to some extent with over the ear headphones but these seem to retain heat more than other brands I’ve tried on  I have been unable to comfortably wear these for more than 5-10 minutes before my ears become uncomfortably warm. Other than that their comfort is outstanding. I don’t feel uncomfortable pressure on my ears or head surrounding my ears which some noice cancelling headphones do to create a better seal. Perhaps that is why I notice more ambient noice. As much as I was looking forward to owning these headphones based upon reviews of their predecessor as well as these by reviewers who received the new model in advance I don’t think they are going to work for me solely because they don’t seem to be well ventilated if that is possible with noise canceling headphones.",Reviewed in the United States on 21 August 2020,
,"I really want to like these.  5/5, the noise cancellation works great.  5/5, the calls seem good.  4/5, the volume control is pretty easy albeit a little hokey.  3/5, they're somewhat comfortable for my big head but start to hurt after 30 minutes.  5/5, the battery life seems long lasting.  0/5, the two device control is awful.  One device control works well.  They easily connect to my iPhone X.  For the 2nd device, when I connect to my Mac, however, the main audio stays with my Mac, and I cannot switch back to the iPhone.  Certainly, the Sony audio app gives an indication that the headphones attempt to switch back to the iPhone, as the primary device, and then the headphones immediately switch back to my Mac, even with every audio and video app shutdown on my Mac.  In fact, the only way I can switch back to my iPhone is to disconnect the Bluetooth from my Mac.  I imagine Sony can fix this with a firmware update which brings me to the next issue, firmware upgrades.  Soon after pairing my iPhone to the headphones in the app--the initial pairing in the app failed until I forced the issue in the iPhone Bluetooth settings, by the way--the app attempted to update the headphone firmware.  When this happened, it stopped at 2%.  Much later, after switching between apps, returning to the Sony app, I saw the firmware update process stopped.  It was only when I checked the version, did I see that the firmware update works.  I would avoid purchasing these until Sony works out the kinks with some firmware upgrades.",Reviewed in the United States on 27 August 2020,
,"I haven't had a set of over ear headphones in quite a while but I thought I'd give these a try based on the stellar reviews of the predecessor XM3 model.  Packaging is nice.  The instructions consist of a fold-out sheet with pictures only.  If you're not up on all the latest technology icons, you'll probably wish for printed words.  There is an additional instruction sheet in about 6-point font that's fairly useless.  Initially, I easily paired the headphones with my Apple TV and was able to use them quickly.  The next day I decided to download the app to get into the finer aspects of setup.  The app prompted a software update and allowed me to play around with equalizer settings and noise cancelling.  I highly recommend using the app in lieu of the cumbersome instructions.  Sound quality is very subjective.  You'll find reviewers who think these are the best ever and others not so much.  I fall in to the second group.  Sound is decent, but not anything that stands out relative to what I've used in the past.  At this price point I guess I expected more.  From a control standpoint, the right ear cup has a panel that you tap to start/pause music or calls, skip ahead or back, and swipe to make volume adjustments.  I absolutely hate the volume adjustment.  Each ""swipe"" is about a 10% adjustment, so if you want to quickly raise or lower volume, you have to make multiple swipes.  And half the time the swipes don't register.  If you aren't swiping perfectly up or down, you will skip the music forward or back.  If you're using the headphones with a device that has its own volume control, I recommend going that route.  It's much easier.  Overall, I'd rate the headphones slightly above average for sound and slightly below for controls.",Reviewed in the United States on 23 August 2020,
,"I've only had these for a few days, so this review may change. I'll update it if it does.

After using these headphones for many hours a day since I got them, I can say unequivocally that they are... fine. They're fine. First of all, it's important to note that I am one of those people who don't know anything about sound mixing, sound quality, equalizing, bass, treble... I don't know anything about any of it. I use my headphones almost constantly - 10 or more hours a day for podcasts, audiobooks, and the occasional work call. So I'm way more concerned with how the headphones function than how they sound because for me, they all sound pretty much the same.

And that's my biggest problem with these. They don't function as smoothly as I wanted them to.

When I turn them on, I hear ""Power On"" then a few seconds later ""bluetooth connected"". But I don't know what it's connected to, because every time I do this, I have then open the Sony Connect app and tell the headphones to connect to my phone. It isn't doing that automatically, even though I only have them connected to this one device. I've tried waiting a few seconds, up to a full minute, and I still had to manually tell them to connect to my phone in order to use them.

The speak-to-chat function is great in theory, but since the headphones (obviously) can't tell if I'm actually starting a conversation or just telling my dogs to get off the couch, they were pausing constantly. (It's possible I talk to my dogs too much) It even pauses automatically when I sneeze or cough. Which brings me to functionality problem #1. When that happens, the headphones are supposed to restart 30 seconds after you've stopped talking. And if you want it to restart sooner, you just unpause them. 8 times out of 10, this doesn't happen. The few times I waited the full 30 seconds, twice going to a full minute, they didn't unpause. I had to manually unpause them. So I turned that feature off, which is disappointing because it's one of the features I was looking forward to.

Which leads into issue #2. You really have to double-tap the right headphone really hard to get them to acknowledge the tapping and pause or restart. Multiple times I've had to stand there tapping the side of my head like an idiot, then still go to my phone and manually unpause whatever I was listening to. The headphones will give a little beep to let me know that they have received my taps, but the book/podcast whatever doesn't start playing again until I go in and unpause it on my phone.

Problem #3 is that if I double-tap the headphones to pause, at least 7 times out of 10, the Audible app, podcast app, whatever I'm using, actually closes so that 1 minute later, when I'm ready to restart, I have to actually open the phone, go to the app and restart again. I can't even just grab my phone and hit the play button, I have to restart the entire app. This whole thing is extremely frustrating.

The volume control isn't terrible, though you have to be pretty precise with your up and down swiping, because if you slant even a little to one side, the headphones are likely to read it as a forward or backward and skip the track whichever way it thinks you want. And you have to swipe a lot, because the volume goes up or down in very small increments.

The noise-canceling seems to work pretty well, though I haven't tried it out as thoroughly as I'd like. One minor irritant, though, is that these automatically turn on in noise-canceling mode, which I don't need or even want when I'm at home, so I have to manually change this every time. That gets annoying.

So I haven't decided yet if I'm going to keep these or not. It's a lot of money to pay for headphones that frustrate me as much as these currently do, but maybe some of these issues are just settings I haven't figured out yet. I don't think so, because I've been through them pretty thoroughly, but I'll give it at least a full week before I make a decision. And I'll update my review once I do.",Reviewed in the United States on 22 September 2020,
,"I got the MX4's for use when driving and in a noisy office location while doing college work. I also listen to music and audiobooks/podcasts nearly all day, and it is not uncommon for me to have a pair of cans on for 8-12 hours daily. Moving forward, my main comparison is with the Senheiser HD599 ($200) and the HiFiman HE4XX's ($150, plus $200 for a Schitt Modi/Magni DAC and AMP setup, coming to a total of $350 for all three pieces of hardware). My use case is pretty high-volume listening therefore, and my musical tastes go from Jazz, Pop and Trap to Classical, Folk, Acoustic, and Rock. Overall, I would definitely recommend the MX4's IF you are needing the top-end noise cancelation, as the hype surrounding the NC performance is definitely more reality than fiction. It makes my commutes and listening experience in noisy environments, including an interstate, very enjoyable and less fatiguing. I also certainly enjoy the convenience and mobility of these headphones, and the battery life has been excellent thus far. However, if you do not need the absolute best noise cancelling, or maybe don't care so much about mobility, then I would not recommend them due chiefly for the price and audio quality compromise. I shall elaborate, first with what I like:

- Comfort (though for bigger ears it may be a little less so).
- Build quality is good for a headphone in this price bracket, given the tech.
- Noise cancelling is honestly unbelievable, though please note these are my very first pair of NC headphones.
- Decent sound for what it is, with good battery life to boot.
- Cool intelligent tech, though admittedly I do not use it at all (I keep NC on at all times and do not utilize the speech recognition feature).
- Mobility.
- Truly some great tech thrown in here, and I can see the R&D going to work, also fairly useful app.

Cons:

- Price.
- Sound quality is lacking when compared to setups at this price point (though I hear it is the best sound quality when comparing to other NC cans), however more on this below.
- Ears can become warm after a while.
- This may be just me, but I have issues with ear pressure changes throughout the day and can cause a feeling of needing to - and not being able to - ""pop"" my ears, which is annoying and causes long-term comfort to be an issue for long sessions, forcing me to switch back to my faithful 599's.

To elaborate, I have HiFiman x Drop HE4XX'S, with a Schitt Modi/Magni stack DAC/AMP. This entire package cost me the same exact price as the MX4's from Sony, and the sound quality is essentially night and day difference. Sound stage, separation, and dynamic sound range is definitely noticeably worse on the MX4's, and there is significant bleed through the bass and mids in some songs. For reference I am listening on Tidal, with Master track quality. Even on my HE4XX's, the bass is tighter and more responsive, and, while not a bass-havy pair of cans, provides a much more accurate and tight listening experience across all ranges. This is partially due to the open back versus closed back design, but again for the price, if you do not care about being so mobile, or perhaps work from home or are a student doing much of your work and homework from a home office or fixed location like myself, I would suggest looking elsewhere. If you travel all the time and absolutely cannot live without maximum portability and noise cancelling, then the MX4's are the way to go. The sound quality is adequate (though I still grit my teeth when considering how much these cost compared to my true audiophile headphone set ups given the sound quality), especially when compared to other closed-back designs, and again the NC is absolutely insane. Another point is that firmware updates will hopefully keep improving on the already impressive and interesting tech inside these cans.

All in all, I really do like the MX4's, but due to the price, it makes me hard to recommend to someone who cares chiefly about sound quality first, and the convenience and portability/NC factors second. If this is the case, I'd say go to something with a better sound profile, and you will likely find yourself spending less with a better musical experience, and a recommendation off the top of my head would be the EXCELLENT Senheiser HD599's (around $200 new on Amazon). Personally, if they would have saved on some R&D and kept the voice and calling features to a minimum but dropped the price, this would be a no-brainer for everyone, but I digress. If however, you need the solid NC and are excited about the mobility and convenience and the versatility that these cans can bring, and are okay with the compromise on sound quality as well as the steep asking price, I would say you would be hard-pressed to go anywhere else than the MX4's. I am still debating on keeping these or not, as I have been spoiled with amazing sound experiences for the past 3-5 years now, and I find it hard to take a hit to my pocketbook like this when I could get a truly awe-inspiring pair of audiophile cans to use with my current setup for the same exact price, though the MX4's are good enough to make it a hard decision which is itself a promising sign.

Tldr; Should you buy the MX4's? It depends, but I do like them, and you need to just consider your use case when making that decision. This is a lot of money to spend on a pair of headphones, and if sound quality plays a large part in your decision, you have some serious competition to look at. Would I say I recommend the MX4's in general? Yes.",Reviewed in the United States on 26 August 2020,
,"Pros: beautiful headphones, above average sound. Class leader in noise canceling. Ability to connect simultaneously to 2 devices is huge. Watch the any number of rave YouTube reviews.Cons: call quality is below average when compared to earbuds such as Airpods Pro. Most importantly for me, the headphones get hot and uncomfortable after wearing for more than 5 minutes. For longer listening or studying sessions, this is a deal-breaker for me. Will return.",Reviewed in the United States on 23 August 2020,
,"I am going to this headphones from the Bose Quiet Comfort II and mainly made the leap after Sony improved their multipoint bluetooth technology, which Bose already has, but also because of Sony's new microphone setup so I can use the headphone for phone calls. Sounds quality is great for songs, calls, and movies. Noise cancelling is great but no better than before. At least I could not tell any noticeable improvement. Call quality is great and I have had no complaints for microphone quality. My favorite features are the really impressive bluetooth range, battery life, and ear phone padding. The bass on this headphone is much better than anything Bose offers right now but I think Bose headphones are slightly more comfortable. I haven't found the wearing detection feature useful or for it to work very well.",Reviewed in the United States on 26 August 2020,
,"Everyone is saying how good these headphones really are, but don't be fooled by that - try it for yourselves. Sure, it has upgraded padding, lightweight, easy on the ears, and subtle design improvements over its predecessor, but that's about where the difference ends - at least from a visual perspective anyway.

I can tell you it sounds great, but that's to be expected from a brand new pair of premium headphones anyway. Listening to them I was not blown away. I didn't get it... until I went back to listen to my old pair for comparison. WOW! Only then could I truly appreciate the immense acoustic separation that the 1000XM4 fields! Perhaps it was the AI upscaling my MP3 to a higher level or perhaps it was just relying on it laurels as a superb pair of high quality headphones. Whatever it was, WOW!

Perhaps the first sign that these were truly a magnificent piece of engineering, was when I put them on. The noise cancelling alone seem to create the feeling that I was in another world, the current world (of sounds) being blotted out. And then the music track dropped.

However, the only real issue that I had was that I wasn't able to enjoy the 360 Reality Audio. I cannot understand why these features were not built into the headphone so that everyone could enjoy it anywhere, instead of a limited subset of people relying on a few less popular websites like Tidal, and restricted to a handful of pre-selected songs. This is not good. People have vast libraries and their own user-created audio files that cannot utilize this feature. Moreover, even Apple or Spotify steaming service cannot access this acoustic engine.

One school of thought is for Sony to use AI to split the audio into several objects and place them around the user in real time, creating a crisp, immersive audio experience. And since custom settings are possible, the AI could play the same song in several different ways or move the objects around to create a real-live effect. In other words - simulated live concert in a headphone.

""Better than the artist intended.""
This must be what Sony intends for in 2022, or how else can there be a WH-1000XM5?",Reviewed in the United States on 29 August 2020,
,"If you want the very best quality, activate LDAC (Android or high-end DAP users). Sony's own app will tell you if LDAC is activated when you play music. If you use Android, don’t forget selecting WH-1000XM4’ Bluetooth connection and then settings, and then activating Codec: LDAC High Quality. (No, you don’t have to do the “developers mode"" absurd advice found on the internet, any phone today select LDAC automatically when available, and even if you try the “developers mode"", the phone will not recognize the LDAC unless you manually activate it from the Bluetooth’s individual connection). If you use lossy music, maybe DSEE is a solution. Any low-resolution music (itunes, Spotify, Pandora…) will not take advantage of LDAC and perhaps will benefit with DSEE. On the other hand, if you listen Amazon Music HD or Qobuz (Tidal uses MQA, so will not play Hi Fi here), please try, to really impress yourself, to deactivate DSEE and ambient sound or noise cancelling: it will be difficult to believe this sound over Bluetooth!When you go back to noise cancelling, try activating DSEE to see if it clouds detail or enhances your music (sometimes, from classical to modern genres this and the equalizer are essential). Sony knows their stuff. From the best headphones they produce (MDR-Z1R) to high-end DAP's and DAC's, and industry leading Music Studios. However, the legendary MDR7506 studio reference headphones are really cheap, just to show you that great quality of sound is achievable without charging thousands of dollars. Don't forget that in some cases the new headphones' diaphragms take a little time to have optimal movement, you will find headphones that sound better after the first hours of utilization.",Reviewed in the United States on 14 September 2020,
,"Excellent headphones.
Quality of music: 10/10
Noise Cancelling: 9/10
Mic: 8/10
Bluetooth Connectivity: 6/10
Aesthetics: 5/10
I'm an audiophile looking for quality headphones that have the ability to listen to music while being able to jump into zoom meetings w/o changing headsets. I've been a fan of the WF-1000XM3 ear pods and bought these to accompany them. They didn't disappoint. You'll need to spend some time configuring these for features like multi-device bluetooth support. The only issue I have is with the connectivity. Sometimes they don't connect as expected and would have to reconnect. This usually happens with just my macbook and would run into issues where the output works but mic doesn't but reconnecting usually resolves this issue. Aesthetics I marked low b/c they're not visually appealing especially in meetings but that's not my primary reason to buy these. An additional feature I like on these headphones is the ability for them to automatically turn off when you start talking. Love these headphones, well worth the purchase price and would buy again even with the connectivity issues.",Reviewed in the United States on 19 September 2020,
,"Noticed that anytime the mics were active, either in a standard phone call or a VOIP call on a laptop, the noise cancelling took a noticeable step back. All ambient noise became much more noticeable. After playing with the NC modes, I feel it's not quite the same as ""sound control off"" - it seems to be blocking certain frequencies? But NC is noticeably reduced, whichever frequencies aside.

Spoke to Sony Level 2 support (which was responsive) and they indicated this is working as designed. The device borrows mics from NC to bring in voice so noise cancelling can't operate fully when the mics are being used. (He also tried to tell me that if it maintained full NC, my voice would be blocked out for the other side - I'll chock that up to ignorance blended with desperation.)

I can understand if the NC was less precise with fewer mics listening, but dropping the intensity of the NC noticeably? Ya?

My Gen 1s from 2017 give me full noise cancelling during calls. This is a big step back.

The pro reviews are singing this thing's praises universally - this is a huge miss IMHO. (And I'm not even going to mention problems with the Android app.)

Probably sending them back. So disappointed.",Reviewed in the United States on 25 August 2020,

Sound quality is amazing, especially once you set the equalizer to how you like. Great all around features such as speak to chat and the sensor in the left earcup that detects when its being used. Multi device pairing works flawlessly, essential feature if you use your laptop and still want to get calls or watch media on your phone while still using the headphones. (Note: to pair with your laptop dont forget to hold down the power button until you hear that its in pairing mode). Finally, I really like the new silver color. Looks amazing in my opinion.",Reviewed in the United States on 23 August 2020,
,"This new version is definitely improved over the previous version, the noise canceling (so far, it’s only been less than an hour of use yet) is amazing, I can’t here much of anything with them on. Sound quality is amazing as well, wider soundstage than the XM3’s and the sound is buttery smooth. At first listen the volume seems a little bit lower at the maximum but with the super noise canceling you don’t need it to be louder. Also this is with the default settings as I have not tried using the equalizer as of yet. Super comfortable and they do seem as if the build is sturdier as well. The speak-to-chat feature is nice but I probably won’t use it much as when I had it on it was pausing at every sound I made (I did set it to high sensitivity which you can change in the app). The headphones came fully charged and updated the software pretty quickly and they were good to go. The best noise canceling headphones just got even better! Highly recommended!Update: 8/31/20 three main issues so far, the battery life seems worse when using the feature to connect to two devices simultaneously and the headphones only connect fully about 50% of the time and I have to go to Bluetooth settings to get them to connect. Also, wear sensor doesn’t always work and when putting paused headphones around my neck it often starts playing again. One more thing: the padding on the ear cups is slimmer and more plush so I feel the actual cups against the side of my face making them slightly less comfortable but not so much that it’s a deal breaker. I do like that you can put two fingers to the touch pad and hold to toggle the speak-to-chat feature on and off which is handier than going into the app to turn it off/on. Also I like that there is a power button in the app to quickly turn off the headphones and that they will auto shut off when taken off after a certain amount of time (although I have no idea how long that is as there is no way to change it in the app).",Reviewed in the United States on 21 August 2020,
,"This headphone has VERY little downsides and many upsides.

Build and Fit (4.5/5): Doesn't feel super premium, but not cheap either. It just has this light, high quality plastic feel to it. The earcup cushions take little pressure to compress, so you sort of feel the body of the headphone press against your head. It's not uncomfortable by any means, maybe just a tad unnatural. But you get used to it extremely quickly. Definitely good for long listening sessions.

Noise Cancelling Performance (5/5): best there is. Simple

Sound (4.5/5): Quite good. Comparing it to the Bose QC 35's, there's more resolution in the audio, and you can make out the lower frequencies much easier. I don't think there's a massive difference between the two, but comparing them side by side the Sony's are a noticeable improvement. I found my favorite EQ setting to be everything maxed out (including bass), then reduce the second highest by 3, the middle frequency by 2, and the second to lowest by one. Allows you to listen to multiple genres without weird distortions.
Compared to other ANC headphones in the same price range, this is definitely up there, but if you're used to other premium ANC headphones, this isn't going to blow you away.

I do have to say though, there are some rare songs where these headphones just butcher the audio and sound like cheap headphones. An example is background percussion in ""I See The Light"" from Tangled. The EQ doesn't seem to fix it. I don't know why. If it wasn't for this, I would give sound basically a 5/5.

Functionality: (5/5). I feel like Sony really had the consumer in mind when they made these. The way they work is just so intuitive and complete. One app gives you complete control over all the tech features, and the headphones always tell you when they change anything. When they connect or disconnect to a device, they notify you. When you're raising or lowering volume, a small thud can be heard to let you know. When you switch to ambient sound mode, the headphones tell you, and then you hear your environment.
Auto pause for taking the headphones off is really handy, and auto off after 15 minutes of pausing music gives me peace of mind.

Overall I would say these are the best overall pair of noise cancelling headphones on the market. They're my default recommendation until someone comes up with something better.
Good job Sony!",Reviewed in the United States on 28 August 2020,

Well worth the hefty price. No buyers remorse here.UPDATE: Please enhance headphones connect app to make it easier to switch between the 2 connected devices on new XM4 headphones.

,"so ive spent many months researching and ordering different over the ear headphone to find the pair thats perfect for me.

first purchased the bose 700
loved them at first, the firmware seemed a bit funky at first, noise cancellation was fantastic with great call quality, but the material seemed to fragile and the cups didnt collapse when closed. im a huge bose fan and decided the quiet comfort 35 (2) were still my favorites compared to the 700.

i anticipated sonys xm4 and decided to wait on the xm3s, behold they came into today (late) and i knew how wildly successful its predecessor was so i had high expectations for the xm4. it did not disappoint, they were very similar to the quiet comfort 35s but more modernized in design, i like the touch controls that are not too sensitive, voice controls are able to be deactivated like alexa and siri, talk to pause feature is neat if your into waiting on your music to resume after your desired 15 seconds, but you can disable that as well. the cushion is very comfortable and they are easy to pair and can be paired simultaneously with 2 devices. calls are clear with a good mic, noise cancellation is stunning, sony did an incredible job with isolation. rich is lows and highs sounds fantastic.
what i do not like about these headphones is the design and structure, they are quality and high performance but i prefer the Shure aonic 50 over everything. the microphone is more sensitive during calls, but its very sturdy and durable and hugs your head, giving me a deep 360 stereo experience. sound quality lives up with shures legendary reputation, with also being able to advance eq your set.
they are exceptional headphones but i prefer the shure aonic 50.",Reviewed in the United States on 29 August 2020,
,"I'm really conflicted with these. The noise cancellation is miles better than my QC 35 and airpods pro, and the sound quality is pretty good too. But these headphones creak to no end at the four points which connect the headband to the earcups. At first I thought it was a defective model so I got a replacement and tried to be as gingerly as possible but it started creaking again. I did some research on the XM3 and it seems these were an issue for those too. If you don't move your head at all it's fine but any movement of the head or jaw causes these creaking noises at those hinges. I really want to keep these because the noise cancellation is that good but when the headphones themselves cause distracting noises I don't know that I can justify these for $350. Maybe $250 for the XM3's and I can put up with the creaking noises but at this price point it's very difficult.Other complaints are fairly minor. Basically all the ""features"" that are advertised (not sure how many of them were also in the XM3's) are pretty gimmicky. The whole ""put one hand over the right ear cup when ordering a coffee""? Just slide the ear cup back and avoid looking like a goof. 19 levels of noise cancellation? I bought these for the max so cancel out the distractions in the back. The ambient sound noise works I guess but the microphones pick up wind noises too much and the headphones shifting around the head when walking make it more difficult to use - airpods pro transparency mode does this a lot better. The whole speak to put your headphones into ambient sound mode temporarily is super annoying. The only useful feature is the two connections, which is new to the XM4's. I personally don't like the pause music when lifting up the left ear cup because if I'm on a call and I lift it up to scratch my ear (which you will do a lot because your ear touches the inside walls of the headphones) and I put it back, my spotify will suddenly start ploying music again. Again, not a huge deal since the noise cancellation is that good. If only the headphones didn't creak so much, it would be well worth the $350. I'll use it for another two weeks to see if there is a ""break in"" period and the headphones stop creaking but if they don't, I'll have to make a tough choice on whether to keep them or return them.",Reviewed in the United States on 27 September 2020,
,"I've owned the same pair of Bose QuietComfort 35 II headphones since 2017. Literally traveled all over with those things. I've had to replace the ear pads 3 times I think, but it was expected as I use them extensively for sales calls, music listening as well as music production and audio monitoring in a professional setting.

With all that said, for the last 3 years, I've felt like the headphones did what they were suppose to and never let me down. They were light, did a decent job at noise cancelation and had a pretty good frequency response with respect to sound. I found the digital voice to be annoying though...

However, as timing is everything, the driver on the Bose headphones start crapping out on me and I couldn't hear much on the left side. Since I need something that is reliable, can handle the frequent calls that I'm on, has good sound characteristics and can pair to multiple devices, I knew I need to purchase something ASAP.

During my search, I was reluctant to look for anything outside the Bose brand. To be frank, I wouldn't have purchased the 1000XM3 since it doesn't have multi pairing functionality. But after reading reviews on the older model, I was somewhat sold on Sony's flagship headphone line.

Then I saw that they had a newer model coming out. It was very hard to wait patiently, even 1-2 weeks, given the amount I use my headphones, but boy was it worth it...

The headphones literally just arrived in the mail this afternoon. I've watched all the pre-release demos on Youtube, and wondered how much of a sales push it was versus if they would actually deliver.

I'm a bit of an audio snob, I like having high end headphones, or even studio monitors for that matter, but let me tell you, out of the box, with no EQ fidgeting in the iOS app, I'm very impressed in the sound quality department. I always listen to my own productions on any new set of speakers, headphones or in a car to compare with how it sounds in reality to how I imagined the song should sound like.

The bass is distinct and not too boomy nor muddied like the Beats lineup, the high ends are crisp and bring a nice air to the tracks, and the mids aren't too overpowering. I don't actually feel the need to change much of the equalization as it's pretty well balanced.

While these aren't thousand dollar headphones with a pre-amp, I would feel very comfortable producing with these on the road, on a plane (after COVID-19 isn't a thing) or even at home. I haven't tested out a lot of the other features like the different noice cancellation settings, although the proximity sensor seems to work well.

It picked up my dogs outside, the tv in the background and even my wife. It’s unacceptable for a product in this price range. I really don’t understand the rave reviews on this. If you are using them solely for music I completely agree but nothing else. I switched to the bose 700’s and it’s night and day for call quality and noise cancellation. Everyone says I am extremely clear now and they cannot hear anything in the background at all. Sound is good but nowhere near the punchy bass and ambient sound the Sony headphones have.

,"I recently started a job that requires air travel, and I knew I would want some good ANC headphones. After reading reviews on the XM3's (before the XM4's came out) I was nearly ready to purchase, but was holding back because of the lacking ability to pair to multiple devices. Even though I personally knew people with XM3's who raved about the sound quality, that one-at-a-time pairing was a serious deal breaker for me, going between phone and laptop for video conferences.

Luckily, just before I needed to make my first business trip, the XM4's were released, and I have been so happy I did. They fixed the multi-pairing issue, the noise cancelling is incredible, and wearing them made for the best small-airline trips I've ever experienced. Sat right on the wing, and when the headphones come on, the engine sounds nearly disappear. Once I started some music or a podcast - I forgot I was even on a plane.

The adjustable levels of noise cancelling, including ""focus on voice"" are fantastic, the sound is impeccable, and the fit is comfortable even after hours. The best part is that the noise cancelling for the person on the phone is as good as it is for you, so you can talk in a noisy place and be heard. And the battery life seems endless - I haven't even seen the bottom half, and I used them for 3 days before charging the first time. These were totally worth paying full price.

That said, I have a couple of wishes:

1. When talking on the phone, the noise cancelling makes it so you can't hear your own voice, so I feel like I'm over-talking for those around me when I'm on the phone. It would be nice if my own voice came back in, just a little bit, so I could gauge my own volume on the outside.
2. The included USB-C charging cable is laughable. Maybe 6 inches. For nearly $400, it could have at least had a 2' or 3' cable. But this this is hardly a deal breaker.
3. The new Speak-to-Chat function has enough delay, that a quick, ""hey man"" is not enough time to switch over - but it will pause your music or movie if you clear your throat.. Not sure I'll keep this enabled. Luckily the ""cover"" function is responsive and instantly allows outside noise for a quick response or to listen to an announcement.",Reviewed in the United States on 22 September 2020,
,"Wow !!! At first I was extremely disappointed that they didn’t seem to sound like the ones I heard on display at a local store, so I researched how to get the best sound out of these so I could hopefully match what I heard.  I succeeded and it was very quick and easy.  The source of your music and quality stream is very very importantThe EQ can work wonders and there are easy tutorials to follow made by bona fide audiophiles that can have your music sounding beautiful, punchy ( just the right amount rather than muffled or muddy).  Just turning off ANC and selecting DSEE extreme (upscales music quality detail through Sony proprietary tech) make a very big difference.  The ANC is wonderful. Transparency mode ( or Ambient sound mode as Sony calls it) works well, but to be honest, if transparency mode is really important to you, Apple AirPods Pro are utterly amazing —the best).  I have always been a Bose guy and it was hard to imagine that these could challenge my Bose Bias from the past.  I tried these and then got ahold of some Bose 700 ( Bose top-shelf competitor for Sony XM3/4) to compare.  Sound detail:  ( quality/detail, soundstage, power, Customization ( EQ, etc) and ANC are clearly superior to Bose.  Call quality is less than impressive to be honest.  It works but not great.  Bose 700 have this hands down.  Final verdict: the win clearly goes to Sony.  This may not help but I also have the AirPods Pro and they don’t have quite the soundstage/detail as Sony but if you are going to use these to make calls and will be mobile a lot where having big cans on your head may not be practical ( in the car or walking around the store), I would choose the AirPods.  Transparency mode and the overall noise canceling quality on AirPods are unbelievable. The sound is really good also ( Sony is better on to be sure).  I do hope this review helps someone out there trying to decide between the three mentioned here. Bottom line is you will really enjoy these",Reviewed in the United States on 27 August 2020,

,"First off I am not an audiophile so there’s that.
But I have had my fair share of wireless earphones with noise cancellation (AirPod Pros and Sony’s wireless earbuds) and mostly gaming headsets.
And let me tell you that this puts them to shame which is a given because of the size. Either way it has amazing ANC that blocks out pretty much anything except human voices and higher pitch sounds but man when your music is playing you are in your own little world just in vibbing. The sound quality is just amazing, and to make things better the app lets you adjust the EQ and bass.

-Battery life is very good along with it being USB-C which also adds the added feature of quick charging them
-Sound quality is amazing and love the option of the app which lets you boost/change the audio setting like bass
-Absoulety love the dual connectivity which lets me easily switch from my phone and MacBook with ease
-Has ANS to block outside world and Ambiance noise to hear the outside world
-The case is such a bonus, you can take them anywhere without having to worry about them getting damaged along with its accessories
-Comes with a aux cable to play music on devices with the 3.5mm jack and the airplane adapter as well
-They at very lightweight
-The touch gestures on the right earcup are cool and feel nice to use

CONS
-The included charger cable is a joke, it’s so small
-Has a lot of issues with the duo connection, sometimes I can’t play on one of my devices and then other times it won’t want to connect to one of my devices
-Due to the plastic design it tends to get dirty quickly and very smudgy by any kind of moisture
-It’s sort of weird and difficult to correctly put up or down the volume because most of the time the earcup thinks you are trying to skip or go back a song",Reviewed in the United States on 22 September 2020,
,"I use the headphones to listen to audio recordings from my smartphone and video from my Kindle Fire HD10. For video I use VLC Player, for audio, PowerAMP. The headphones are somewhat difficult to set up. I do not yet understand all of the options offered by the Headphone Connect app, but it appears to offer many options for customizing the audio to my ears.

As did another reviewer, I found the audio latency a bit much - about 500ms, or 1/2 second. I don't know what is normal for a bluetooth connection.

I haven't had a chance to try them on an airplane, having cancelled a trip due to Covid-19 concerns. But I found a Youtube video of a 747 taking off, played it back through my stereo, and found that the headphones canceled out nearly all of the lowest frequencies.

I received the headphones three days ago, and have used them mostly around a swimming pool, where they filtered out most of the nearby conversations.

I had some no difficulty pairing with my LG smartphone, but needed about an hour of on-line chat with Amazon before they worked with my Kindle Fire HD10. I don't remember all the details, but I do remember being asked to 1) restart the Kindle Fire, 2) restart the headphones, and 3) press both the power and custom buttons on the headphones until the blue light flashed four times.

I also found the instructions hard to read - the print was too small for my aging eyes, even with reading glasses.",Reviewed in the United States on 4 September 2020,
,These are great headphones but sometimes all the features with ambient sound are annoying.  These headphones are made by Sony but they are too new for the Playstation 4 to recognize therefore you have to plug them into the controller for them to work. I also have a QLED tv thats only like 5 years old and they don't recognize the headphones either.  If you plug the headphones into the controller they lose the ability to control the ambient sound settings so if i say 1 word the noise canceling goes away assuming you're going to have a full conversation. So everytime I answer someone a simple yes or no I have to push the button to get the sound to play again which gets tedious after awhile.  I had the Bose Quiet Comfort II headphones before the XM4s and I miss the simplicity of having some physical volume up or down buttons ..especially since the XM4s touch controls go away when you plug the headphones into the PS4 controller.  Other than that if I'm using the headphones with my phone its nice to have the touch control options back.  The sound quality and noise cancelling are top notch ..so it gets 4/5 ..i just hope they are compatible with PS5 because plugging them into the controller sucks.,Reviewed in the United States on 10 September 2020,
,"I bought this headset primarily for work. Since transitioning to working from home several months ago, I've spent 5+ hours a day on phone calls and video conference, and wanted something comfortable and noise cancelling that had a great battery life.

First, the positives:
- The sound is great. There's good range when I listen to music, and the voices in calls are clear
- They're comfortable. I can wear them all day without them hurting my ears or the sides of my head
- Battery life really is 30 hours. I've been using them for 5-6 hours a day since I got them almost 2 weeks ago, and have only had to charge them a couple of times

The negatives are things are mostly related to the multipoint connect and the app, which honestly never even occurred to me when I was picking them out:
- Some of the videoconference apps are flaky with this headset. Skype and Zoom are fine, but when I use Teams or Webex, people can hear me, but get no audio. These work fine when I switch to my 5+ year old bluetooth headset, so I'm pretty sure it's not a setting on my Mac
- The Pause function doesn't work right on the computer. If I move the headset off my ear while I'm on a video conference, it automatically starts any video on any tab I had open when I put it back on. I keep a lot of tabs open, so sometimes it takes me a minute to find the youtube video it randomly restarted
- Weird and constant little beeps in the background. This only seems to happen when I'm connected to Mac as my second device, and I still haven't figured out why, but it's really distracting
- Multipoint doesn't always connect to the alternate device correctly. If I'm watching a video on my computer and a call comes in, I'll hear it ring, but when I pick up, it doesn't automatically switch top the headset, and I have to select the headset as my audio input on my iPhone

I really think most of these things are just bugs with the app or firmware that will get ironed out, but be aware that if you're using this mostly for work, you may be a little frustrated by some of the functionality.",Reviewed in the United States on 3 September 2020,
,"ANC is great, but situational.  Please understand that ANC does not make music sound better.  It blocks out ambient sounds, noise and voices.  It won't cancel out direct wind nor your chewing.  While the sound is very good, I'm sticking with my Sennheiser Momentum TW's, which in my opinion sound better.  Mid's to me sound a bit muted, otherwise the highs and lows are pretty good.  I'm not a huge fan of over the head cans either, but I was willing to give these a shot.  Being able to pair these and have them connected to multiple devices is a big plus, but as always trying to use these (BT) as a computer mic/headset is a very poor experience, especially with Discord (I really wish companies could figure this out).  Great battery life and these can be updated with firmware for future proofing.  The white is not really white, it's more gray and contrary to some belief, they do not look more premium, but they don't look cheap either.  It's personal preference really.",Reviewed in the United States on 31 August 2020,
,"Headphones are all about compromise, like most things in life. I have several sets for different use cases and these are the most expensive, though not by much. It's important to realize that a good chunk of the money you spend on these is not going to sound quality, per se. You're paying for good battery life, good noise cancelling, decent build quality, multi-device wireless radios, the speak-to-mute trick, and the new proximity sensor. Sound quality is subjective, but I found it awful with the EQ off and didn't like any of the presets. I took me two days to find a setting I was just okay with and the sound is kinda bad in comparison to my wired B&O H6s. I personally even like my Jaybird Vistas more, though those fatigue my ear canals during extended use. That said, I fully expected this as they are all about comfort and active cancellation for noisy environments and in these categories they are great. The feeling of putting them on and suddenly being in your own bubble of quiet is very cool, but again, that's what you're paying for. The talk to mute function is very cool, but is slightly pointless because it's frankly just rude to talk to people with your headphones still on.

Pros:
+Crazy Bluetooth range. No dropouts in normal use
+Noise cancelling is nice. Not earth shattering but nicely tamps down common humming noise like HVAC
+ Speak to mute works well and is very useful.
+Multi device support is awesome and works pretty well
+Comfort is decent

Cons:
-Sound quality is just OK.
-The proximity sensor that's supposed to pause and shut them off doesn't always work
-The swipe controls are hot garbage. Sony should be able to afford a proper dial at this price point.
-Battery life is highly variable depending on what you have enabled.
-The added pressure from the active noise cancelling fatigues my ears, but that is likely a personal thing.

Takeaway: I am not personally sure these are better than passive noise isolating buds like the Vistas, that I feel have comparable or better sound quality. They are definitely more versatile however.",Reviewed in the United States on 30 September 2020,
,"After a lot of research and watching raving reviews, I decided to buy these over the Bose NC 700's for Sonys supposed superior, richer soundstage and stronger noise cancelling despite the Bose winning out in call audio quality in every test. However, upon putting my Sonys on and listening to music (in a wide variety of genres) I could tell immediately that the sound in the lows up to the mids was *extremely* muddy and not clear. The bass was way too punchy to be enjoyable as well (Don't be fooled, I love bass heavy music). I also realized that the customizable EQ feature doesn't have much control over tuning the problem frequencies (lows, mids). After more research and listening to more audio quality and call quality videos, I ended up returning these and buying the much cheaper and better audio quality Sennheiser PXC ii's (with the same amount of battery life).",Reviewed in the United States on 14 September 2020,
,"I purchased the Sony WH-1000XM4 wireless headphones to use primarily with Zoom, which has become essential for my business. It's proved to be great for that application — I've had no problems with hearing others or with speaking (i.e., no complaints).

This is not my first pair of noise-cancelling headphones — I've had a couple of Bose wired headphones (sold one, bought the other, which is still in the closet) primarily for air travel (you remember that, don't you?) . Problem with my old Bose sets is the lack of a microphone, so I debated between the Sony and the Bose wireless sets that incorporate miss, and I read all the reviews I could find on subject.

Although the Bose generally has a slightly better rating for the mic, the Sony was favored for sound quality in every review I read. And they were right! The sound quality is exceptional for all uses, especially music, the noise cancellation is amazing, and the mic is more the adequate for my needs.

Very highly recommended!",Reviewed in the United States on 6 September 2020,
,"Absolutely love these. Noise Cancellation is incredibly effective. It takes quite a lot to hear through it even without music. I suppose the pausing during conversation feature could be smoother, but that isn't a big issue for me. Amazing battery life and features. Sound quality is superb, probably the best I've ever heard from headphones. Rich bass that you can feel, and the highs and mids are punchy and crisp and don't get lost. Incredibly well balanced sound. As for comfort, it took a small amount of adjusting but they feel like a cloud. Soft, supple leather, and there isn't too much clamp force. They do stay on, too. Love that they can be wired or wireless, as I have both a phone and a desktop (the letter doesn't have Bluetooth). The case is light yet firm, and even has a mesh pocket on the back to hold your other goodies. The texture of the cans is luxurious, and the same holds true for the case. Mic isn't perfect, but it's good. Overall, it's very expensive but a great buy if you're in the market.",Reviewed in the United States on 12 September 2020,
,"UPDATED:  I decided to mark these down from 3 to 2 stars because, in the last few days, the bluetooth has started to act buggy.  Audio files simply stop playing for no apparent reason (in some cases, my music has stopped apparently because someone else with a bluetooth device gets within about 30 feet of me, but in other cases the music stops for no apparent reason at all).  At other times, there are skips or pops.  While the noise cancellation is fantastic, and I'm still thinking keeping them for this reason alone, I'm now more likely to return them -- $350 is just too much money for these kinds of problems.These are great headphones -- outstanding in many respects -- but they have some issues that, given the $350 price, do not merit a 5-star review.  I was torn between 3 and 4 stars, but decided on the lower rating given the very high price for this product.PROS:1) ANC -- by far, these have the most effective noise cancellation of any ANC (or other) headphones I have used, including Bose.  They drown out almost all ambient noise -- including close lawn mowers, leaf blowers, revving car engines, etc. -- even when you're not playing music or listening to another kind of audio file.  When playing music or an audio file, you are very much in your own world.  I did have an issue at the beginning where I could hear a static-like sound when ANC was on but no audio was playing.  A software or firmware update pretty much, but not entirely, eliminated the issue; it's still noticeable from time to time, but at a very low volume, lower than the older set of wired Bose ANC headphones I still have.  It's no longer an issue for me; I think that this kind of noise is a ""feature"" of ANC headphones.2) Comfort -- by far, these are the most comfortable set of headphones I have used.  The ear pieces in particular are outstanding.  I bought another brand of (much less expensive) headphones right before I got these and wrote a review in which I said those were very comfortable.  However, I wound up returning those because, after about a week, they became quite uncomfortable.  These Sony headphones, however, have withstood the test of time, seeming to become more comfortable as time goes on.  I can comfortably wear these for hours.3) Music quality -- excellent, what you would expect of Sony.4) Gesture controls -- the gesture controls for turning music on / off, picking up a phone call, volume and next / previous song work quite well.  I had a set of Sony 900 headphones prior to these, and the gesture controls work a little better on these.CONS:1) Default volume -- for some reason, these headphones, like my prior Sony 900 headphones, seem to have a high default volume and there is no way in the Sony Headphones or Sony Music Center to change them (and there is also no native iPhone setting that works, either).  The result is that, all too often, music comes blasting out at an uncomfortable, probably unhealthy volume when you put the headphones on and start playing music.  Beside the Sony 900, none of the other (many) headphones I have used have had this issue.  I have now become accustomed to checking the iPhone's bluetooth volume when I put the headphones on, but all too frequently when the iPhone shows a low bluetooth volume, the volume resets itself to a much higher (almost max) volume when I actually start playing an audio file.  I believe the problem must be related to the fact that all the settings for these headphones are run through the Headphones app and there is no control for default volume in that app; apparently, Sony sets a near-max default volume and doesn't allow users to change it.  It's really quite annoying, and I may wind up returning these headphones for this reason.  For $350, Sony could do a lot better on this metric.2) Phone call quality -- meh.  Some calls are good, others not so much.  Nobody on the other end has complained about call quality.  However, on my end, the other person often sounds distant, low volume, in a tunnel, etc.  Every other set of wireless headphones I have used with phone call capability has been at least as good as these headphones, and some have been better.  I read that the MX4 is supposed to have corrected the problems of the MX3 regarding phone call quality issues but, if that's the case, I can only imagine how bad the MX3s were.3) Making you register with Sony in order to get updates -- as noted above, I needed to do a software or firmware update to get rid of the static noise when ANC is turned on.  However, to get software updates, Sony requires you to register with it (provide email, etc.).  It is obnoxious of Sony to require users to provide this kind of personal information that it will then market and sell, and presumably also spam you with promotions, as a precondition to getting updates to fix the bugs in its (expensive) products -- particularly where Sony has a history of data breach.Bottom line, these are mostly excellent headphones, and they are exceptional with regard to the primary purposes of noise cancelling headphones.  However, they do have some problems that a $350 set of headphones should not have.  I'm likely to keep them, but if the default volume issue noted above does not improve, I may well return them.",Reviewed in the United States on 24 September 2020,
,"This product is pretty great. It is a solid improvement over the M3. I will be doing a comparison between MX3 and Bose 700

Pro
- Multipoint connectivity
- Better Microphone than the M3
- No cold weather problem with the touch controls
- Really good noise cancellation in general** (see cons)
- Significantly better touch controls than Bose 700. The Bose 700 touch control area is really small
- Adaptable noise cancellation
- Speak to pause music (this is pretty gimmicky it works great until you are in a room crowded with other people. This is probably a software issue that can be resolved)
- Software updates from Sony. (this is a big win for this headphone because my headphones updated twice upon using the headphones for first time) Bose suck in this department. Bose actually released a software update for the Bose 700 that actually caused the headphones to malfunction (wrong battery indicator, Static when connecting to multiple devices, or straight up bricking the headphones. As of 9/4/2020, Bose still has not resolved this problem that has been going on for 3 months!)

Con
- Noise cancellation is generally good except for when there is direct wind blowing at you. The wind comes through the noise cancellation. Bose 700 does not have this problem (although I suspect this is a software problem)
- Multipoint connectivity is really slow. It takes a significant amount of time to switch between one device and other. Bose 700 again does not have this problem (although I suspect this is a software problem)
- As of 9/4/2020, the multipoint connectivity option has a software bug. Upon first setting up the headphones, I could not enable the multipoint connection on the app. However, after restarting my phone, the option worked. (Again mostly software issue).

Overall, solid headphones I would definitely recommend. Most of the problem is just software which can be resolved. Solid noise cancellation, Solid sound. 8.5/10",Reviewed in the United States on 5 September 2020,
,"Let me explain. I am an audiophile, music enthusiast..., you get the picture. To me, sound is pretty much everything, with comfort and build quality (how long the product will last) also being important. Hours upon hours of research online led me to those beautiful pieces of art. 9/10 of the websites I visited had these at the #1 spot so I placed my order. When I got the package, I headed straight for the instructions, read what i needed to know, and carefully pulled out the pair of cans. The design, as I have said before, is beautiful. As I tried them on, I noticed how incredibly light and comfy they were. The moment I turned them on, the noise cancelling kicked in, and, o wow, the world really does fall away. Now, the moment I've been waiting for. I plug them into my phone, turn my phone down to protect my ears (haha), and play ""I Like Me Better"" by Lauv. First reaction: OWW. The treble is flat out painful. So then, I connect the headphones to my phone over bluetooth and set them up within the app, taking pictures of my ears..., (Yes it customized the NC and music to your ears, which is kinda cool.) I prefer a wired connection, because I listen to FLAC music files (CD quality music) and bluetooth degrades that quality. But, I tried it anyway to see how it would go. The app was pretty simple to use, and finally, I found it, the eq. I turned down the treble a little and pressed play on the song. It sounded aweful. I put the eq back to flat and it sounded exceptional quality-wise, but still piercing. The moment I turned down the treble again, music dropped out and turned back on, sounding really bad. I scrolled down in the app and found out that to use the eq, it lowers the quality, and noticeably. I was done. These were returned the next day.",Reviewed in the United States on 26 September 2020,
,"So i'm not the most prolific reviewer nor am I under any illusion that anyone gives a darn what I think about anything. However, I spent a ton of time agonizing over the decision between getting the Bose NC-700s and the XM3's last year and went with the NC-700s, which I've used consistently for over a year. So I'm thinking my experience might at least be helpful for those trying to decide. In a bit more than a week of consistent usage of the XM4's, there is categorically NO CONTEST between the two headsets for one major reason.

The key difference is that the XM4's JUST WORK. Initial setup was hilariously easy, to be sure (not so much with Bose, but that's a one time thing). Connecting and disconnecting from various devices is a breeze and works consistently. Contrast that with the NC-700's, which would constantly have a clicking noise when connected to two devices (a critical need for me when working from home). On top of that, they developed this bizarre issue where phone calls would drop from the headset to the handset at random and i'd have to manually shift it back to the headset. If you use Google Assistant, I've found the button on the XM4's to work consistently, unlike the one on the NC-700's. When connected to multiple devices, the XM4's can tell where they need to play from with no trouble. The NC-700's would need to be disconnected and reconnected to show them where to play from, which was lots of fun when hopping onto conference calls for work.

Other considerations:

Noise Cancellation: Small edge to the NC-700s. The XM4's get 4.98 stars out of 5 while Bose gets 5. Realistically you will not be able to tell the difference. I can't say i've used the XM4's in an airport or on a flight yet, but I do have several kids running around the house all day and they perform just as well as the NC-700s.

Features: Sizable edge to the XM4's. Loving an equalizer in the app. Wearing sensor and movement sensor are pretty nifty.

App: Bose's app is clunky and extremely unreliable. I have had ZERO issues with Sony's.

Sound quality: Pretty close but small edge to the XM4's. Surprisingly fuller bass.

Comfort: identical. I wear headphones for 4-8 hours a day and both are fine

Battery life: Sony wins out of the gates with 30 hours, but an important note is that the NC-700's never really lived up to their advertised 20 hours, and the battery quickly builds up a memory from consistent use so that ended up shrinking over the course of the year by about 20%.

Bottom line: no longer having to spend 20-30 minutes a day fighting with the NC-700's technical issues nor being driven nuts by the constant clicking gave me the time and sanity to write this review.",Reviewed in the United States on 18 September 2020,

,"I have been using these for a little over a month now, and have not experienced any issues. The sound and noise cancelation quality are great, and the microphone is OK. When I first received, I was having issues connecting and switching to a 2nd connected device but after a couple of app updates, it seems to have corrected the problem. The sound and microphone quality are not as great as my Bose 700s; when compared with the Bose, others have indicated that my voice comes through a bit clearer and more isolated than with the Sony XM4s. The fit on the Bose is slightly more comfortable and lighter than the XM4s also. I do appreciate the touch sensor functionality and ease of use over the Bose, as well as the capability to customize the sound and adaptive technology. Overall, my preference are these over my Bose 700s for ease of use and seamless transition between two connected devices (laptop and mobile phone). But for extended use with connectivity to only one device, then my preference is for the Bose because they are more comfortable to wear for long periods at a time.

The noise cancellation is easily confused if you walk into different rooms, which causes you to hear a static noise for several minutes, or longer sometimes.

The bluetooth connections are clunky. You'll often get notifications about various primary or secondary devices connecting or disconnecting. I guess these can be muted, but it's still annoying.

If you use these for podcasts, or anything other than playing music through an app, it doesn't sound great. It might be the noise cancellation. My $20 headset sounds so much better than these when I use them to plug into my piano when I'm playing.

With the XM4, I needed to tweak it in the Headphones app using the EQ to get it to the place that I wanted it, but once it was there, it was great.  A small but pleasing improvement in the XM4 is that the headphone voice announcements are at a much higher quality.  The XM3 announcements are low fidelity and low bandwidth whereas the XM4 headphone voice is very crisp and hi-fi.  Sony also replaced the high-pitched beep with a slightly longer but more pleasant sounding bell for feedback.  However, I actually prefer the beep because it's faster.Noise cancelling: A-When I first put on the XM4 and turned them on, I was surprised by the audible hiss from the noise cancelling.  It wasn't present with the XM3.  I think this is because they have cranked up the noise cancelling in the XM4.  I have air purifiers running in my house, and the XM4 does a better job of cancelling out the noise almost completely.  The XM3 still has some leakage.  The XM3 is just as good as the Bose in noise cancellation, and the XM4, though a little hissy and is a slightly bit better.  The drawback to this is that it can feel like it's creating a slight pressure in my head that increases over time.Multipoint Bluetooth: FThis was the feature I had been waiting for.  The awesome noise cancellation and sound of the XM3, but with the ability to stream two devices at once.  FAIL!  I had been eagerly anticipating this and checking daily for the release of the XM4.  I was so excited to get them...only to be sorely disappointed.  Though the device will connect to two devices simultaneously, it actually DISCONNECTS when one of the two devices is activated.  So it's not true multipoint Bluetooth.  Sony advertises that the multipoint Bluetooth is seamless.  This is true if they mean you don't have to press any buttons to disconnect from a device.  However, the way it manages connections is very poor.  I have to put the XM4 into pairing mode if I've connected to my phone in order for it to play audio from my computer.  If I don't do this, it doesn't recognize that my computer is playing sound, and then doesn't stream the sound.  Even though it shows on my computer as connected, it doesn't show up in my sound options as a device that I can use for audio.  I have to turn them off, put them into pairing mode, and then reconnect in order to get the sound to play.  If a call comes in on my phone, the headphones actually disconnect from the computer to switch to the call - and the headphone voice announces that they have disconnected, super annoying and not seamless.  With the QC35 II, I could use both at the same time, with the phone being connected at the low-quality voice mode and my computer at the high quality music mode.  They had 2 years to get the multipoint Bluetooth right and they totally failed.  So it ends up that I have to turn the XM4 off and re-pair them just like I had to with the XM3.  I've had to do this a number of times, and I haven't quite figured out all the exact situations where I have to re-pair them.  With the XM3, I knew if I wanted to switch devices, I would have to do it.  But with the XM4, I haven't put my finger on all of them just yet.  At any rate, the switching of devices is very clunky and definitely not worth upgrading for.  I have $40 headphones that implement multipoint Bluetooth better than the XM4. I'm stunned and disappointed that Sony hasn't been able to get multipoint Bluetooth to work right.Comfort: ACompared to the XM3, the XM4 are slightly softer and a bit more comfortable right when I put them on.  The XM3 are still pretty comfortable, but the earpads are definitely firmer and a little tighter.Controls: BI totally prefer the actual buttons on the QC35 II to the touch controls.  Sometimes if I want to change the volume and I slide my finger at a slightly off-angle, it will skip tracks instead.  It's a small annoyance.  On the plus side, the physical buttons do make a fairly audible click that travels through the headphone, whereas the touch controls are a little quieter.In-call: DOne thing the Bose QC35 II does is that when I'm on a call, it knows to automatically turn on ambient sound mode so I can hear myself talking.  Neither the XM3 nor the XM4 figured out that this is a useful and great feature, so they don't do it.  If I want it, I have to press the button to switch to it, listen to the announcement, and then it comes on.  Then when I'm done, I have to press the button and wait for it to go into NC off, ambient sound off, and then press the button again and wait for the announcement that the NC is once again activated.  Super slow and awkward and unusable.  So instead, I pull one of the earcups off my ear so I can hear myself speak.  When I first was using the Sony's for calls, I was finding that my voice was tired and my throat sore at the end of the day.  Someone told me that I talked really loud when I was on the phone.  I didn't even know this because the headphones do a really great job of keeping outside sound out, so I was talking at a level so I could hear myself when I was wearing them.  I asked Sony support about this, and the headphones just don't do this.  Fail.Auto-mute: FSony created a feature where the headphones will automatically mute the audio source if it detects that you're talking.  Nice in concept - terrible in practice.  I just turned it off and left it off.  If I'm listening to music and sneeze or make a noise, the headphones will interrupt what I'm listening to and mute it for the amount of time I've specified in the app - 15 seconds is the shortest amount of time.  So I have to wait for it to unmute so that I can continue listening.  What's even more annoying is when I'm using the auxiliary cable in wired mode - again, this is because the multipoint Bluetooth implementation is such a pain and sucks, if I'm on a video conference and I have the headphones on to use the noise cancelling, if I talk, it mutes the audio stream for 15 seconds so I can't hear what anyone in the conference is saying.  So I then have to turn the headphones off in order to interact with the conference in any meaningful way.Miscellaneous:I don't understand why Sony doesn't just include a headphone cable with a microphone.  With all the video-conferencing I do, and the terrible multipoint Bluetooth implementation, I end up using the auxiliary headphone cable a lot.  It's much faster and convenient for me to switch the plug from my computer to my phone rather than dealing with the horrible Bluetooth switching.  The auxiliary cable Sony provides doesn't have a microphone, so I have to hold my phone close to my mouth if I'm using the cable.  I ended up buying an auxiliary cable with a microphone and some playback controls on it and it works great.  Here's another really poorly thought-out thing: upon pairing the new XM4 with the app, it gives me the opportunity to give feedback on the headphones.  This is only upon the initial startup of the headphones.  How on earth can I give meaningful feedback about the headphones on my first use?  It took me to Sony's site to do the survey, and I decided I would complete it later, only to discover that it had timed out, and now I'm not able to provide feedback through that mechanism.Conclusion:All the hype about multipoint Bluetooth is a big letdown with the real product.  If that's the reason you're thinking about upgrading, don't do it.  The rest of it is pretty similar to the XM3.  Some nice little features added, but nothing earth shattering.  The new features on paper were everything that I wanted that was missing from the XM3.  In practice, the XM4 implementation of these things just did not hit the mark.  I soooo wanted to love these headphones, so that I could stop looking for headphones.  As it stands, they totally weren't worth the upgrade and I will most likely be sending these back.  Sadly, they are not as advertised.",Reviewed in the United States on 19 September 2020,
,"So, I was skeptical coming from Bose that anyone could beat their noise cancelling ability and comfort, but I kid you not...I love these Sony headphones. I wore them all day today and my ears are not sore one bit, additionally the noise cancelling is awesome, I didn't hear a peep in the background. They performed excellent via bluetooth on my conference calls, which is a big win vs the Bose QC.

,The product has good sound equivalent to a Bose headphone and the noise cancellation is close. However the blue tooth connection makes this product almost useless. I am used to Bose headphones after set up pairing automatically. The Sony headphone must be connected to the phone or computer manually every time. Even though I am 2 feet away from the source the music skips and  disconnects requiring a manual reconnect every 10 -15 minutes. This is a very expensive headphone and having this connection problem makes this a clearly inferior product.  It has superior sound and noise cancellation and if you use this on a cable there is no problem. However if you plan to use blue tooth do not under any circumstance buy this product. You will simply have to send its back and reorder a Bose or other product. Caveat Emptor !,Reviewed in the United States on 13 September 2020,
,"I have used Bose in-ear noise-canceling headphones for a while. I wanted to try an over the ear headphone. After a long time reviewing my option, I decided to buy a Sony headphone. It came, and I used it for about two weeks; here are what I found.

It is a great headphone overall. It has a lot of bells and whistles in its app. However, I am not a fan of having so many options. Especially when they are not being set right by default. I give you an example. It has a multipoint connection feature, which is a good thing to have.
Additionally, it has a sensor that, by default, pauses what you are listening to when you take it off and unpause when you wear the headphone. The issue is that on a few occasions, it unpaused on my other devices that I was not listening to when I took the headphones out. I can disable this feature in the app. However, why add a half-baked feature which can annoy the user?

Here is the list of pros and cons for this headphone:

Pros:
- Great noise canceling
- Nice build
- Nice case
- Comfortable to wear
- USB-C charging
- Fast charging
- Regular headphone jack port for wired connection
- Long battery life
- Auto-off

Cons:
- It gives my wife and me a headache after less than an hour of usage.
- It has too many bells and whistles that are not implemented well in some cases. You need to dig deep into the app and change the default to make the headphone behavior better.
- Touch control is not easy to use, and it frequently does something other than what I wanted it to do.
- Slower to connect than Bose headphones.

If I didn't get headaches, I would have kept it. I also bought Bose QC 35 II to compare, and Bose headphones did not give me headaches, so I am returning this and keep the Bose one. Headache is probably a personal thing and might not happen to everyone, so if you don't get a headache, I would recommend this headphone.",Reviewed in the United States on 14 September 2020,
,"I recently bought these and I had high expectations. It noise cancellation worked good, Streaming music and taking calls from phone was good as well.

Problem was when I connected via Bluetooth to my PC for online gaming. I would get interference when I'm right next to my PC. Checked settings, contacted customer support but issue was still there.

For the price of these I expected better.

*Update as of 9/17/2020*

I decided to give the headset a 2nd change. I returned my previous dongle and bought a TP-Link WiFi 6 AX3000 PCIe | Bluetooth 5.0 card. This helps the headset much better!

,Dislikes - no plug for charging ; only a charging cord which is only 5 -6 inches in length. Chrome plated jacks instead of gold plating - thrifty considering the price.  Hard to access or identify volume controls on the headphones; Noise cancellation is decent if playing music; not so much when listening to an audiobook or conferencing.  Don’t know if it is superior or equal to the Bose noise cancelling.  Weight of headphones surprisingly and pleasantly light.  Fast charging is a plus.  Unable to determine if headphones can be synced to multiple devices.  A bit of a challenge to get it to sync with my iPad had to move to a room where other Bluetooth devices did not interfere.  This could be because I have an older model iPad.  Not sure whether the better buy would have been the previous model. Some static or background noise experienced when shifting from ambient on/off/noise cancellation.  Bought it over the Bose because it seemed better material design than the latest Bose quiet comforts which appear to be built using low cost materials. Controls are placed on the left headphone which is disconcerting for a right handed person like me.  Power on/off button continually failing; I have to plug headphones into the usb plug to get it to power back on even though it’s fully charged.  Reconnecting to apparently older devices is a chore and frustrating.  Will probably return before the return period expires.,Reviewed in the United States on 29 August 2020,
,"This is everything I wanted, except, for some reason these headphones cause me to be nauseous. This is a common problem with noise-canceling headphones, google the article ""Noise-Canceling Headphones Might Make You Motion Sick,"" but I've never experienced this problem before. ANC takes the incoming sound, inverts the phase, and plays it back with such efficiency that some brains can't handle two different frequencies in each ear. I suppose the noise-cancellation could be so good on these that I have never experienced this level of ANC. It's just odd.",Reviewed in the United States on 25 August 2020,
,"setup: 1000xm4 paired with a Xperia 10 series (LDAC capable)

i watched sooooo many videos of reviews of the 1000xm3 vs top line competition, be it Audeze or Sennheiser or Bose or etc.... whatever was available to watch in comparison on utube, i prolly watched most of em.

the top feature is the Active Noise Cancellation and number one reason to get these over the competition. its sublime! literally puts you in your own space clearing out 90% of surrounding noises. without any music. these are mostly the lower frequency sounds, but it still does great with higher frequencies also, like a running faucet, birds, etc. now.... turn the music on, and you are on a far planet called Solitude. enjoy!

i am not fond of cables, so while it does have a 3.5mm jack for great analog listening, and lower frequency response (all the way down to 4Hz vs 20Hz via bluetooth), i also got it for the LDAC. this is bad news for me, because any less quality via Bluetooth will be subpar. it is worth noting, there is no version of AptX supported. if you take (via the app) the headset out of quality mode and put it in connection mode it switches from LDAC to AAC with the option to use an automatic DSEE Extreme upscale. if you do not have an LDAC transmitter, DO NOT buy these, get the 1000xm3. they are pretty similar but still have the AptX & HD capabilities plus DSEE HX. i read online that Sony could add the aptX family back with a firmware update, but i do not believe this correct because the bluetooth chipset in the new 1000xm4 is NOT Qualcomm, who owns AptX tech. Per Sony's website, now they use a ""new Bluetooth Audio SoC (System on Chip)""

just like a new car or new shoes, i decided to do the burn in immediately. 192 kHz Pink noise layered with a pure 24bit Sine wav from approx 10-200-10Hz for 48 hours. 2 days is a small price to pay versus finally hearing the better sound 2-3 weeks away. imo.

they sound great. i have a noticeable quality difference from the same source material. the clarity is fantastic, crisp hi's, clear distinct lows, mids that are defined. Sony is the keeper of the music... they have so much material to use in dialing in these headphones, it shows.

one thing that stood out to me as way different than most all reviewers... i did not like to wear them more than a few hours at a time, and definitely not in a warm environment, like the Arizona sun. not just my ears being warm, rather everything under the headphone was substanitally warmer. and i usually have the volume down below 40%, so it isnt headphone heat. i bet i can wear them all day in the winter time.

,"These things have just the right amount of clamp on the head.  Not distracting at all even after hours of use.  The sound separation is just epic.  Solid bass, crisp highs and a good mix for vocals.  The equalizer that's saved in the headphones is very nice.Noise cancellation is almost too good.  If I have them on in the house I can hear absolutely nothing but the music.Definitely worth the money, especially if you need that two device support.  I have them hooked up to the computer for Teams calls and my phone for taking real calls at the same time, and the pass off is seamless.The only drawback is the pass-through isn't as good as like Airpod Pros, but that's a minor quibble here.",Reviewed in the United States on 30 August 2020,

,"I have been using the Sony WH-1000XM4 headphone for few weeks now and they were very frustrating to use at first, they are working good now, but it took way too long to get to this point. I bought them to use with my work laptop, Zooms call and etc, in addition to listen to music. Connecting to the headphones with my work laptop was simple and quick but that was the only easy and simple part. The laptop has an intel Bluetooth radio installed by OEM. The Sony WH-1000XM4 headphone and the built in Intel Bluetooth radio were not compatible, I updated to the latest Intel  Bluetooth driver but it did not help. The headphones would become unusable when disconnecting from one Zoom/Teams call and then trying to join another call shortly after, have to love back to back meetings. I did a quick web search and found many others with this same issue, the Sony WH-1000XM3’s have same issue, according to my web search. To resolve this issue, I had to purchase an aftermarket Bluetooth radio, connecting to my laptop vis USB port. I had to disable the Intel Bluetooth radio installed by OEM to get the headphone to work the laptop. As far as sound quality and noise canceling they do work as advertised but if you want to use them with a laptop and you have an Intel Bluetooth radio, you are in for a frustrating time till you get a separate Bluetooth radio.

,Best headphones in the world,Reviewed in the United States on 30 August 2020,
,"I have historically not been a massive fan of noise-cancelling headphones.  I mean, the idea is simple... take an input sound, send it 180 degrees out of phase (and at the same amplitude), let destructive interference do its thing, and combine it with the waveform of the sound you actually want the user to hear.  Simple, right?  Well, sound comes from different directions, is attenuated to different degrees by the headphones/your head/etc., has some intrinsic latency added in the sound processing, headphone frequency response limitations, driver frequency response limitations, and about a million other technical issues.  However, the Sony WH-1000XM4 are highly rated, right?  I wanted to see how they'd do...The Sony WH-1000XM4 arrives in a surprisingly small box.  This is because business travelers are frequently targeted for noise-canceling headphones, so the retail packaging is roughly the size of the hard-sided carry case located inside.  The tilt/swivel/rotate articulation of the headband allows for the headphones to be broken down into a very compact 8.5x6x2"" case.  Accomplishing this requires smaller ear cups than I'm used to.  My ears fit inside, but they: 1.) aren't that large, and 2.) weren't as comfortable as in some headphones that are more spacious.  This is subjective, and YMMV.  Comfort is about a 7/10, but I noticed that they felt quite warm (from my head, not from the electronics) after about 20 minutes.  Not terrible, but not awesome.  Side note: I got mine in ""silver"", which is really just grey.As for the sound quality, well... I was a little disappointed.  The quality is fine, and I don't think it's a matter of driver size as I've heard better at 32mm and 50mm (the Sony uses 40mm drivers), but I feel like some nicer drivers would have been welcome here.  None of this to say that the output is bad... it's not - it's just not as good as some less feature-filled units from Sennheiser that cost over a $100 less.  Since these are ""active"" headphones, you can apply an in-unit EQ, and they have tons of sound processing available.  I tried out the DSEE feature, which is supposed to use AI upscaling on low-res digital music.  About 80% of the time I couldn't tell a difference... and the other 20% of the time I'd be hard pressed to say the results were ""better"", even though they were noticeably ""different"".  Meh.  Then again, if you're spending over $300 on headphones, it's probably a safe bet that you're using higher-res compression, or lossless - if you case about such things.Getting the most out of your headphones does require downloading the app, which I was prompted to do when I paired my headphones to my Google Pixel 3 XL.  The app linked to my Google account.  I declined to use some of the available integrations, but still had full access to the app.  I was prompted for some firmware updates, which happened in the background.  You can have some of the features be location-aware, but those require your phone to be accessible.  In fact, much of the operation requires your phone - so that's worth keeping in mind, if that type of thing bothers you.  The app is pretty intuitive, and I didn't experience any app or phone instability with the app or headphones.As for the noise cancelation... the headphones, when off, do not attenuate ambient noise as much as some of my other headphones.  That was a little disappointing, as you'd think that would be an important first step in the noise-cancellation goal, right?  Well, I have a 24"", high-speed fan behind my chair.  In its slowest setting, it's still quite loud - loud enough that it must be turned off to participate in voice/video meetings.  With the headphones off, it sounds like you're in the fuselage of a WWII bomber.  With the headphones over your ears, and noise cancelation off, the sound is more of a dull roar.  With noise canceling on, the character of the noise goes to a higher pitched static (like white noise), with a much lower sound floor.  The wild thing is that it's very tiring.  I guess that makes sense... the sound pressure is the sound pressure, however, it is a little odd for your ears to feel tired when there's little apparent audible sound.  This effect isn't nearly as pronounced when the external sound isn't as loud.  I feel a much less serious amount of this fatigue using the headphones on a plane.Value?  I'm undecided... I feel like people who either want these to get sleep on planes/trains, or want to be able to pipe in ambient noise with the press of a button (because they need to interact with the environment at unexpected times) will probably benefit the most from these.  If your intention is to listen to content, and want noise isolation, I feel like a really nice set of closed ear, NON-canceling headphones would be a better choice.  Conditionally recommended.",Reviewed in the United States on 18 September 2020,
,"Headset is fairly lightweight, ear cups aren’t as deep as some headphones but deep enough for my average sized ears.  Cups are soft and the overall comfort level is high, even after extended play time.The touch controls on the ear cup are very slick and help reduce the number of physical buttons.  However, taking the headphones off (or putting them on), I’ve accidentally turned music on as it mistook the contact as a command.  Not a deal breaker but a quirk to be aware of.  The auto-pause when you remove the headphones is a nice touch too.Noise cancelling is truly excellent.  I was working in my office, window open, tower fan blasting.  Silence.  Took my headphones off and there was a police helicopter flying circles over our house (nothing to do with me!!).  The only downside is that it’s SO good that I literally cannot hear my wife talking to me and this has earned me some angry glares.  In the app settings, you can adjust the level of background ambience that the headphones filter out but I cannot find a balance where the noise cancelling is on but still allowing my wife’s voice to be heard.  Unfortunate but some may consider that a benefit!The headphones are paired to my desktop computer (a 2011 Mac Mini with Bluetooth 4.0) and to my phone (an iPhone 11 Pro with Bluetooth 5.0).  Between the two, it seems to connect faster and more reliably to the desktop.  I’ve had a couple of instances where I struggled to get it to connect to my phone after it successfully connected to my desktop.  Full disclosure:  I’m running the iOS 14 beta on my phone and it’s not exactly super reliable.  I feel like the Bluetooth got better between Beta 6 and Beta 7, so take this observation with a pinch of salt.The optional “Speak to Chat” feature (if you start to talk, it lowers audio playback) is clever and works well but there IS a slight lag before it kicks in.  It also caught me off guard today when I was in a WebEx meeting because it essentially shut off the WebEx audio and I then couldn’t hear responses to my comment.  Had to disable that feature for the remainder of the meeting.The 360 audio feature is kinda hard to comment on.. in the demo within the app, you can clearly hear a pleasant difference (it’s more immersive).  In practice, after signing up for a free trial with a supported app (TIDAL), I don’t really hear it.  On a side note, the TIDAL Master track streams sound amazing on these headphones.  Like.. truly amazing.  Not sure I want to spend $26/month but it’s got me thinking about seeking out other lossless / higher quality sources for my audio streaming.Regarding the setup process for testing the 360 audio.. photographing my ears would not work using the automatic capture system and was very frustrating.  Manual capture worked better.  But ultimately.. I don’t think that the effort was worthwhile, given that I don’t hear a difference in supported 360 apps.Speaking of audio quality.. these are great headphones.  The default EQ out the box feels a little muddy / bass heavy (or at least not to my taste) BUT the app lets you tweak this, has some nice presets and custom curves for you to set up.  What’s great is that the EQ you set up from the phone app also works when streaming from other sources (e.g. your computer).  It’s global, which is exactly what I was looking for.I’ve listened to a lot of tracks I’m familiar with, some less so, and heard little nuances that previously I’d missed.  There’s a lot of detail here.  With DSEE on or off, I’m not worried about wireless compression negatively impacting the signal.  It sounds great.Overall, these are a fantastic set of noise cancelling headphones.  Highly recommended.",Reviewed in the United States on 5 September 2020,
,"I previously owned the WHXB900N headphones from Sony, and my experience with them was good. I decided to take the chance to upgrade to the WH-1000XM4, and I am glad that I did. The WH-1000XM4 is a major upgrade, and a lot of my complaints about the WHXB900N have been addressed in the WH-1000XM4.

First of all, the packaging for the WH-1000XM4 is great. You get a carrying case with accessories and the headphones. There is space created in the case to store the headphones flat as well as the extra cables and connectors, as well as a handy guide that shows the touch functions on the headphones.

My headphones had about a 1/2 charge on them. I already had the Headphones Connect app downloaded as well as Music Center, which are the two apps that work with the headphones. You will register the headphones and adjust the settings with Headphones Connect, and then you can extend the features further through the Music Center app. I had no issues connecting the app to the headphones, and once connected the apps worked well for me. I mainly just use Headphones Connect. I believe Music Center is more for controlling multiple Sony speakers and headphones easily.

One of the complaints that I had with the WHXB900N is that the touch controls are very sensitive. You can activate voice control simply by tilting your head too far to the right when wearing the headphones. The WH-1000XM4 fixes this completely in two ways. First of all the touch controls on the headphones are not so easily triggered. The other great thing is that you can use the app to turn off touch controls completely, which you cannot do with the WHXB900N. Using the ear analyzer, you will get a better result with activation of the touch controls. The ear analyzer will analyze the shape of your ears and then optimize the headphones touch functions for your head.

The WH-1000XM4 still has the ability to lower the volume of the headset by covering the right earcup with your hand, and now it upgrades this by also adding the ability to lower the volume by speaking. So now you can have the volume automatically be lowered when you start talking with the headphones on. You can also enable a setting that will automatically pause your media when you take the headphones off. Sony also included the ability to back up the settings and restore them via the app. There is an amazing equalizer in the app as well as the ability to automatically change the noise cancelling depending on your environment.

The noise cancelling of these headphones is second to none. Just turn the headphones on and put them on, and even without playing any music things will be a lot quieter. When you are playing music, the noise cancelling really allows you to focus on the sound and filter out background noise. You can turn off noise cancelling if you would like, and you can also configure the custom button to control this feature.

The sound you get from these is amazing. The bass is very rich, and combined with the automatic optimization for environment, you get a fantastic experience when you use these. There is a built-in microphone that picks up sound very well, and you get a great range on the Bluetooth. There is a cool quick charge feature, where if you charge the headphones for 10 minutes you can get five hours of playback. The headphones also use a standard 3.5mm connection if your audio device does not have a Bluetooth connection.

You get a trial card for 360 Reality Audio, which works with specific apps to provide super high fidelity audio. The only thing is that you can only use it with 3 apps total, and once you pick an app, you cannot change it. Also, for the apps you cannot use them with existing accounts, which means you have to create a new account to use them with, which is a waste.

I really love these headphones. They are a bit pricey, but the sound and features that they offer really make up for the price. These are a contender for top competitor with the Beats headphones.",Reviewed in the United States on 30 August 2020,
,"I am not an audiophile but I use headphones regularly and am familiar with most mainstream brands including previous Sony models within this price point and this pair has superior sound quality and excellent noise cancelling (NC). They are lightweight and comfortable to wear for extended periods, have a long battery life, use Bluetooth 5.0 and if working at home or traveling, effectively block out everything but voices which sound far off in the distance.

Details.
Most important is the sound quality which is beyond impressive. The headphones have a bright upper range that is not tinny, a clear full midrange and a significant but not overwhelming lower range—all well-defined and nuanced. Something new for me, they have initiated a re-visitation of my music library because everything sounds so good.

The headphones can be used with either Android or Apple Sony Headphone Connect apps which allow customization of NC and sound quality. But, the headphones can be used without any app. I used the Apple app and enjoyed the extra features like the ability to connect to two devices and switch between them, turn-off NC, adjust the sound profile to my taste—and back-up the settings so they are consistent on all devices and if lost can be easily restored.

The app also provides a convenient interface to access all music sources on the connected device along with the internet. Included is a 90 day trial for one of three subscription services that provide 360 Degree Reality Audio content that work with these headphones. I tested one of the services, Tidal, and it provided a complete immersive surround sound experience. The services have fees that start at under ten dollars a months and go up from there.

The headphones work smoothly using the Alexa app loaded on my phone. I simply asked questions like--Alexa tomorrow’s weather? or Alexa, tell me a joke? or Alexa call Joe—all were promptly answered through the earpiece. Using Siri worked but was not as straightforward requiring a tap and hold on the right earpiece to activate instead of simply saying--Hey Siri.

Also, to avoid frequent removal of the headphones to carry on a brief conversation/answer a question, etc., a temporary pause in music and NC can be achieved in two ways. The Speak-to-Chat feature kicks-in when the wearer starts talking and when the conversations ends everything resumes. Another method is to simply hold a hand over the right earpiece which pauses the music, suspends the NC and amplifies outside sound. All automatically resume when hand is removed from the ear cup.

In order to avoid unsightly buttons there are touch panel controls which are intuitive to operate but are not as precise as buttons so they may need to be repeatedly tapped or swiped. Since I normally control headphones through my smartphone this isn’t an issue but may be for some users. Also, I used the headphones for phone calls and the sound was acceptable on both ends.

The battery life and quick recharging is outstanding and far exceeds any of my other headphones. There is a sensor in the left ear cup that automatically turns off the headphones when they are removed which conserves battery. The included 8 inch charging cable is USB A to USB C and there is no included adapter for USB C charging ports which I could have used and others may need. There is also no AC wall adapter. A 4 foot 3.5mm audio cable and airplane adapter plug are also provided.

Included is a zippered oval shaped hard shell fabric covered case with a mesh pocket on the outside and a carry loop. Inside there is room for the headphones and included accessories. A user-friendly feature is a quick guide insert in the case that serves as a reminder of how to fold the earphones and operate the controls—and the neutral matte silver color is a good change from the usual black.

Overall excellent.",Reviewed in the United States on 1 September 2020,
,"I have reviewed a number of pairs of headphones for Amazon over the years. These take the top spot in terms of audio quality and noise cancellation.

-=Build Quality=-

These are extremely comfortable, lightweight cans which still have the premium feel I would expect from headphones at this price point. They have Sony's customary, conservative styling, and collapse nicely into the (included) high-quality case.

-=Setup and Bluetooth=-

Pairing is very fast, and the headphones had no issues at all staying connected to my Android phone.

-=Software=-

Configuring the app takes a little longer than the norm because, if you want to activate the proprietary 360 technology, the app asks to take pictures of your ears and send them to Sony (seriously). Whether or not this accomplishes anything is a mystery to me, and the step is completely optional. The headphones sound great either way.

The equalizer works very well, allowing you to fine-tune the audio profile to your preferences. There are also some other nifty features, like the ability to disable noise cancellation for a set amount of time when the headphones recognize that you are speaking (this proved more useful than I expected). You can also use it to keep noise cancellation running even when no audio is playing.

The app is full-featured, fast, and intuitive (at least on Android), and actually worth installing.

-=Controls=-

Controls are touch-based, requiring directional swipes on the right ear cuff. I had a few misses, but overall found it to work smoothly and intuitively.

-=Audio Quality=-

The audio quality is exactly what I would expect from Sony at this price point. Mids are distinct and have depth to them. Highs are clear and have a nice sharpness to them. Bass (which I prefer not to overdue) can be cranked to a thunderous level using the equalizer on the app. When combined with a lossless audio source (I used Tidal, thanks to a gift subscription from a friend) the sound is astonishingly good.

Sony's implementation of its ""360 Reality Audio"" feels like pure wizardry. Combined with songs engineered for it (again, I found some on Tidal) the sound is completely immersive, with the sense of separate channels disappearing.

-=Noise Cancellation=-

The sophistication of the noise cancellation algorithm on the WH-1000XM4's has to be experienced to be believed. Even before I started playing music, the ambient sound around me disappeared immediately. Everyday hums and background noise like a water cooler and light traffic were gone immediately.

With music playing, everything else disappears completely. Even the clacks on my mechanical keyboard were gone.

Do NOT wear these if you need situational awareness, including if you are supervising children or operating a vehicle. I'm not making that as a joke - the noise cancellation is so complete that it takes great intention for sound to penetrate. This is the best noise cancellation I have ever experienced.

-=Conclusion=-

I cannot find a single flaw with these headphones. The comfort and quality are top-notch, as is the clarity of the audio. The noise cancellation is nothing short of stellar. Even the app, typically the weak point even for high-end cans, is intuitive and useful. I have no reservations about giving these my very highest recommendation.",Reviewed in the United States on 13 September 2020,
,"I don’t have much technical knowledge about audio equipment inner workings and specifications, but I know what I want from my wireless headset. I want quality clear sound, easy and reliable wireless connectivity, noise canceling, simple operation, long battery life, quick charging, hands-free calling, compatibility with Zoom, and comfort. These headphones meet and exceed all of my requirements, plus offer things I didn’t even know that I wanted, but now I don’t want to be without.
The quality of sound is crystal clear and outstanding in my opinion.
Establishing wireless connection to my iPhone was a breeze and took a minute or two at the most. I’m also enjoying that I was able to connect to two different iPhones and switch seamlessly between them.
I also like that I can use these headphones by themselves for basic operation or download an app, (which I did and strongly recommend) for more advanced options.
The noice canceling is hands down the best I have ever had with headphones. The Custom button allows for the optimal noice canceling for the user, and it couldn’t be easier to use. These headphones made a huge difference for me in working from home and thanks to their noise canceling abilities my productivity had increased.
I love how simple it is to operate them thanks to their touch control panel. I’m enjoying the fact that I don’t have to fumble for buttons or a remote, and instead all I need is to touch, swipe, or hold the side of my headphones. I’m also a big fan of the fact that these headphones detect when I take them off and they pause automatically.
The battery life is great. I didn’t time it exactly but it is at least 24 hours. They also charge very quickly. I found myself almost out of battery power while I was working, and a quick 10 minutes charge allowed me to finish the few hours of work I had left.
The hands-free calling and compatibility with Zoom work great for me. The sound is clear and I’m also heard clearly and well understood.
I also find these headphones very comfortable and light. I don’t have any problems with wearing them for extended periods of time. My husband and daughter had also tried them and they were both able to adjust them perfectly to their head sizes.
The carrying case that comes with these headphones is strong, impeccably made, and the gray color is pretty and gender neutral.
I was trying to think if there was anything I didn’t like, and the only slight negative is that when wearing these outside when the temperatures are high my ears can get a little hot, but I think that might be the case with all headphones of this size and I’m completely willing to deal with that in exchange for their amazing noice canceling abilities and the clarity of sound, which I assume comes in part from a tight fit around the ears.
All in all, I couldn’t be happier with these headphones and fully recommend them.",Reviewed in the United States on 5 September 2020,
,"First and foremost, the sound quality is excellent. These create an immersive and detailed experience, with a somewhat warm but balanced sound on the default equalizer setting. The highs are crisp, and bass is powerful.

The active noise cancelling on these headphones is life-changing. I’m the sort of person who prefers to work in the quiet reading room of the library with earplugs in, and when I am l seeking to truly focus on a problem, I don’t want reminders that there’s anyone else in the universe. Since the transition to work-from-home, my Tasco Nextera passive ear muffs have become key to my sanity while sharing the house with others, sometimes with earbuds snaking underneath for music while I work. For eliminating sounds in the vocal range plus general household noises, these Sony headphones are actually superior when noise cancelling is on, while the 20 different levels of ambient sound control let me fine tune my desired situational awareness when I’m not trying to hyperfocus. I haven’t had any issues with eardrum suck.

Pairing was easy and the Bluetooth range is phenomenal; I can wander the house without ever losing my connection to my computer. These are comfortable for hours of wear, and the battery life will get me through nearly a work week of listening, plus the quick charge feature is a lifesaver when . The touch controls are intuitive. The smart features are something of a mixed bag, but a few tweaks in the settings in the app improved things. Turning notification and voice guide off in the system settings eliminated the large number of annoying dings, and I’m happier with speak to chat turned off in the sound settings. Pausing music by taking off the left earphone can be finicky at times. The Sony app’s equalizer offers the opportunity to create custom presets to fit individual preferences. The microphone is more than adequate for Zoom meetings. It does pick up some background sounds from my home, and the audio quality doesn’t come close to rivaling my Blue Snowball, but vocal clarity isn’t a problem.",Reviewed in the United States on 7 September 2020,
,"These M4 headphones are an update to the highly-regarded (“industry leading”) M3s. They continue to place their emphasis on sound. Of course, you can use them to greatly reduce the background noise. If at home, it might be appliances or traffic; at the office, perhaps the constant drone of other voices. I even used them while using a shop vac, and I was impressed at how much it reduced the noise.

If you use them to listen to music, you will appreciate how they use Artificial Intelligence to flesh out your lossy .mp3s. It works quite well, adjusting to different music. I was amazed at how much detail I was able to hear

One of the biggest changes from the M3s is the multi-device connection, which allows you to connect to two devices at the same time (say, your laptop and cellphone), so you can quickly go from one device to the other. So can be listening to something on the computer and answer a call all from the same headset—and it automatically pauses one feed when another is ringing. I have been able to connect them to both PC and Mac laptops, and to an iPhone and an iPad without any difficulty (only actually connected to two at once, of course).

The microphone is actually 5 microphones, helping you be heard on calls.

There are other useful technologies—if you leave the gps function on, it will learn the ambient sound profiles of various places you go and adjust the noise canceling to work better in each location.

These are premium headphones at a premium price, but if you are looking for something more than just glorified earplugs, and you use even some of their many capabilities, you will be glad you have them, at home, in the office, or on the road.",Reviewed in the United States on 2 September 2020,
,"Wow, Sony really upped the game for noise-cancelling headphones. These pretty much have everything you might want in over-the-ear headphones. They're very comfortable to wear for long periods of time, the active noise cancellation works great (and can be customized in Sony's app), and the sound quality is awesome. I have the older M3's (which are also great), but the overall sound quality on the M4's seems better. Where I especially notice a difference is on phone calls - the package mentions that the M4's now have 5 microphones to pick up your voice more clearly.

There are some cool new features that makes these more convenient also. Cupping your hand over the right headphone lowers the volume so that you can hear what's going on around you better. There is also a ""speak-to-chat"" function that pauses what you're listening to when you start talking. I probably won't use that one much, though, as it is pretty sensitive and seems to pause when someone is talking loudly nearby, and occasionally coughs.

One thing that I really appreciate is that Sony now allows you to connect to two Bluetooth devices simultaneously. If you are listening to music on one device and want to switch to another, you just stop playing on the first device and start playing on the second. It also means that you can hear a call coming in on your smartphone while listening to music on a different device.

I used Bose headphones mainly in the past, but I think Sony is the new king of the mountain for active noise cancellation headphones.",Reviewed in the United States on 31 August 2020,
,"Pros:
- Excellent packaging and clear instructions on how to use
- Bass is excellent!
- Noise cancelation
- Touch controls work flawless once you spent 3 mins learning them

Neutral:
- Comfort is good, but not amazing.
- Lots of features I probably wont use (like speaking will automatically stop music play)

Cons:
- Expensive when compared to older models that are almost as good

Overview:
As an audiophile, I love me some good music. If you have the money, just go and buy these. If you dont own any noise canceling headphone, picking up a used Bose QC 35 and buy brand new foam ear pieces will provide you with 90% functionality of these.

I have used them on a 4 hour flight, and first time wearing them I did feel some discomfort after hour 2. Coming home some reason the discomfort was gone and I had them on my ears for 6 hours and didnt want to take them off (just to stay in my own world).

One other item I like these over the QC 35 is the volume is louder on the sonys. Both have great bass, but the sony does feel like it has a fuller base frequency than the bose.",Reviewed in the United States on 28 September 2020,
,"I've tried quite a few of headphones, especially recently. These headphones are by far the best of all. I got into the WH series headphones for the first time with the XM2's. Once I got those I decided I needed headphones of that quality for the rest of my life. I upgraded to the XM3's when they came out, and now the XM4's.

The noise cancellation on these things is unbeatable. It always has been with the Sony WH headphones. My favorite feature on the new version is the automatic pause when someone starts talking. Sometimes my girlfriend yells for me or comes in my office while I'm working and starts talking and these make it so much easier to hear her the first time.

They are so lightweight and the charge lasts an incredible amount of time. I listen for hours every day and only have to charge them occasionally. If they die, you can plug them in for 10-15 minutes and get a couple more hours of music in before finishing the day and charging them overnight.

Love Sony headphones, you should definitely get a pair!",Reviewed in the United States on 13 September 2020,
,These headphones are amazing. Now I don’t have to much feed back on noise cancellation because this is only the 2nd pair of noise cancellation headphones I’ve owned but I’m happy with it once I have these on just the sound warp of noise cancellation activating is somewhat mind boggling I get scared sometimes when it activates lol but overall I’m happy with these very comfortable wearing for long periods. Stay on during a workout. Love the speech recognition on it meaning though I can’t hear really anything around if someone tries to get my attention and I begin talking the headphones will adjust and I can hear clearly. Lots of features on here using the app helps adjust to perfect settings. Case that comes with headphones is nice as well includes aux cable if you are planning to use wired. Overall I would definitely recommend these headphones. I’m happy overall with them.,Reviewed in the United States on 10 September 2020,
,"Sony's new WH-1000XM4 active noise-canceling headphones are incredibly disappointing given their hefty price tag ($348 on Amazon at the time of this review) and the fact that these are apparently meant to be top-of-the-line. For that kind of money, you expect excellent sound, effective noise-canceling, and premium build quality but Sony delivers on none of the three.

The sound when playing uncompressed music files is clear and crisp but with little presence or life--my two-year-old Bluedio Victory Pro headphones sound way better. I tried using an equalizer to liven up the sound without success. I also tried an audiophile music player called Power Amp Pro that offers a number of customized sound options including completely bypassing the phone's default sound processing in favor of higher quality processing built into the app but that did little to improve sound quality. Bypassing the sound processing built into my smartphone almost completely eliminated Sony's noise-canceling which suggests the WH-1000XM4 is relying more on the combination of Sony's Android app and my phone's hardware for noise-canceling than on hardware actually built into the headphones.

What makes the flat sound even more frustrating is that these headphones are actually capable of sounding a whole lot better. In Sony's Headphones Connect app, there's a demo for 360 Reality Audio sound processing and the improvement heard in the song sample is striking, with significantly richer, livelier sound. But there's a catch--360 Reality Audio sound processing only works with three premium streaming services that hardly anybody actually subscribes to--Deezer, Nugs, and Tidal.

Not one of those is even among the top 10 most popular premium streaming services used in North America based on the number of paid subscribers. That means if you normally use Apple Music, Spotify, or Pandora which together have more paid subscribers than the next 7 in the list combined then you're out of luck and won't benefit from 360 Reality Audio sound processing.

When using Sony's Headphones Connect App on a compatible Android or Apple device then you can turn on DSEE Extreme which is supposed to utilize AI Technology to accurately upscale compressed music. The reason you need to be using Sony's app is that Snapdragon, Kirin, and Exynos CPU chips from the past several years include AI Processing Capability which is what Sony is relying on to try and upscale compressed music.

Noise-canceling is also a pretty big disappointment because these headphones don't seem to be capable of completely canceling noise at any frequency--if I put these headphones on in the living room while music is playing on the stereo I can still hear the music very clearly--although the volume is significantly reduced. While walking outside listening to music I can still clearly hear the sound of passing traffic.

I used to own a pair of wired Bose Noise Cancelling headphones and could put them on just to block out the world if I had a headache or needed a break. That's not a possibility with these Sony headphones because the sound of anything and everything still gets through--just at a much lower volume.

As if these headphones weren't already a big enough letdown they also look and feel cheap--I've owned $50 headphones that felt a lot more premium thanks to the nearly all plastic build which is not something I expected at this price point. It's possible these headphones are more durable than they look but for $348 I think Sony should have made an effort to give these headphones a premium look and feel and grey plastic just doesn't do that.

All of these shortcomings would be easier to swallow at a lower price-point but spending a small fortune on headphones that don't sound great and feel like they could break the first time you drop them doesn't make very much sense.

,"I really love the feel of them.  They're much lighter than I expected, and I can lay back comfortably with them without any edges bumping on my chair.  It makes for a great listening experience.I do really like that they use a standard 3.5mm jack, so I can use any old extension cable, but the cable it comes with is great.  I really wanted to pull the cable in and out to get an exact reference to with and without bluetooth, but every time I unplugged it, it unpaired and shut off.  It also kills the tilt to pause function when they're plugged in.I used the Korn Dead test as it's become the best way for me to determine the quality of headphones.  That song starts out with highs, adds lows, and lot of mids, and then plays everything together.  Quality headphones will allow me to hear everything seperately.  Poor quality will mush everything together like trying to play basketball with bad depth perception.  With noise cancelling on, it sounds like upper level mediocre.  Turning off noise cancelling sounds much better.  It seems that I have to choose between quality or killing background noise.  It's worth keeping in mind that most people probably won't hear the difference, and if I wasn't directly paying attention to the music I might not either.The bass is great.  I could actually feel the vibration in the earcups if I turn it all the way up.The noise cancelling is what I would call pretty good.  If I turn the music off and want to sit in silence with noise cancelling on, I can still hear the words of people around me, and can make out what they say.  To get the effect I want I would have to play some white noise.  If I listen to music with noise cancelling on, I can't hear anything around me.I really like the smart features to turn down the music when something important is happening.  One of the big reasons I don't use headphones often is because I'm always paranoid that I'm going to need to answer the door, or my phone's going to ring, and I won't be able to hear it.  In fact, the number one reason I use these is because I can pair them to my computer and my phone, and when my phone goes off it'll automatically switch to my phone.  I miss even less by having these on.Overall I'm very happy with these headphones.  They produce great sound, and if I need something to drown out snoring, I can throw on the noise cancelling with some white noise to put me in my own world.  Then when I get a call in the middle of the night, I'll send it right to my ear where I need it.Highly recommended.",Reviewed in the United States on 3 September 2020,
,"It has been more than a decade since I last owned and used Sony noise-cancelling headphones, so I was particularly interested in their most recent developments when acquiring these headphones.  My background as a long-time audiophile and FCC licensed broadcast engineer who regularly tested and evaluated high-end audio equipment for a leading component stereo retailer is the experience I bring to this review.In my opinion the most important feature of any brand of headphones is the quality of sound.  Without great sound I don't believe that any of the other features matter much.  I am pleased to report that these headphones deliver a true, sweet, wide-spectrum palate of sound from the highest audible frequencies to the lowest head-rattling bass.  Another good measure of sound quality is lack of ""listener fatigue.""  Even inaudible distortion can cause listeners to become weary of listening.  These headphones can deliver a full day and evening of exceptional Bluetooth sound from a single battery charge.Sony's ""adaptive"" noise canceling is more effective than any other headphones that I've tried.  The soft headphone pads begin by providing a very good seal against outside sounds.  Then the adaptive noise canceling feature of these headphones gets rid of most of the remaining outside noise, thereby providing a quiet, isolating listening experience.Using the same smartphone app as Sony's Bluetooth earbuds, which I also own, it promptly recognized these headphones, quickly established a wireless connection and downloaded/installed a software update, giving me full control of these headphones from my smartphone.  That included being able to select options, including Alexa voice control and adjustments of the audio spectrum to my own listening tastes.Other features include the headphones ""knowing"" when they have been removed from my head, quickly stopping the audio stream and eventually automatically shutting off to preserve battery power.Nowadays, decent noise-canceling headphones are available for less than $50, so what's the big deal to spend $300 more?  My answer is noticeably better, wide-spectrum, distortion-free sound, superb workmanship in the headphone's construction, ability to customize the sound to one's tastes and the best noise-cancellation that I've ever experienced.",Reviewed in the United States on 1 September 2020,
,"I've heard a lot of wonderful things about the Sony noise cancelling sets like these, and let me tell you: it isn't just hype. The sound quality is excellent, and the noise cancelling is eerily amazing. I put it on my wife and kids with the noise cancelling off and then turned it on to demonstrate, and you can see each them suddenly smile like ""whoa"". Like my Sony studio headphones I use professionally for work, the actual fidelity of the sound it reproduces is excellent, and the microphone for calls is excellent despite being up by my ears and so far from my mouth (other bluetooth headphones I've tried were good for music only, the mic being up by my ears wasn't good enough to isolate my voice from ambient sound, but this definitely does a great job).
The app gives a ton of control beyond what I expected to really customize the experience. For example, I have mine set to auto-pause if the headphones are removed, and to turn off noise cancelling when it detects me speaking to someone, and then resume playback when the headphones are removed/replaced. These features are all customizable, as well as many more. But you need the app. And this is where the cons come in:
1) You really need the app to get the most out of this. I was thinking about pairing this with my desktop and/or TV, but without the app you have far less control, and to be honest I couldn't even get it to pair with my phone using just Bluetooth alone. There seems to be a way according to the instructions, but I couldn't figure it out without using the app installed.
2) For a set that costs this much, I'm surprised at how scuffed up it got after one fall from about 3 feet next to my car. Including pictures. This happened the day I got it. I'm not sure if there's anything that can be done about that, pavement is hard to recover from if anything is dropped, but it's something to keep in mind if you're spending this much money on a gadget. My studio headphones have been roughed around for years and held up fine.

All in all, I'd give it 5 stars if it weren't so reliant on the app to get the features going and/or more resilient to being dropped. Feels like I should deduct one for that. But as far as features and sound quality go, this is a solid 5 out of 5.",Reviewed in the United States on 10 September 2020,
,"I'm not a headphones guy.  I almost exclusively use canal-phones and have tried lots of middle-road varieties such as V-Moda, 1-More, Klipsch, Shure (high end).  I have never really found the pair of headphones that could hang with the canal phones for quality and noise isolation.  Boom!  These just changed my entire view of headphones.  They are super soft and comfortable, and light.  They do tend to fall off if you are trying to wear while laying down which makes them tricky for the gym.  When the noise cancellation kicks in, it is like you got teleported to outer space.  It's just ridiculously good - like 95% decrease in ambient sound.  I haven't tried them while mowing yet, but that's next.  The sound quality is the best I have ever heard.  The software walks you through the setup process very nicely, including taking pictures of your ears for some sort of optimization...I'm skeptical and didnt get to compare before and after.  Anyway, all cool stuff.  the controls on the side take a bit of getting used to but are fairly intuitive.  Hard-wire cable presumably for PC access is fine, probably wont be used.  The battery life is just unbelievable!  30 hours is bananas.I'm usually not a pay-top-dollar for the best of best kinda guy.  I'm usually a pay half and get 95% kinda guy, but man...I'm not sure that there's a 95% option out there.  These are in a league of their own.  I didnt think I needed them before I got them, but now I probably wont leave home without them.",Reviewed in the United States on 8 September 2020,
,"I have had the headphones for a few weeks and this my initial impression.  I have  owned multiple Bose over the years (QC25, QC35, and QC35 II) and I have owned many lower end Sonys.  A couple items that were a con for me.  First the noise cancelling works well, but it does mess with my ears more than the Bose do.  QC25 is still favorite noise cancelling. The other is I had issues connecting them to Windows 10 PC via bluetooth.  They would connect but were not seen as an audio device.  On the positive side, the sound is excellent.  I believe the sound is more well rounded than Bose. Sony provides more bass.  The headphones are very comfortable and I have no issue wearing them for hours as long as turn noise cancelling for some of that time.  The app provides great flexibility for adjusting the headphones.  I like the option for noise cancelling automatically turning off when I speak.Sony has made an impressive pair of headphones with the Sony WH-1000XM4.  The premium quality and features justify the premium price.  I would defintiely recommend them",Reviewed in the United States on 30 September 2020,
,"I found these headphones to be an excellent choice for both comfort and function
The earpads have very soft pads and are big enough to cover the whole ear; the headband is also padded with a very soft cushion making these headphones design very comfortable.
The ear pad can be adjusted to different angles, they turn very smoothly, and I do not feel any pressure in the ear area whatsoever, I can use them for very long periods of time.
The audio has a truly clear sound with good bass.
It has good power and volume; when I use them, it has a noise cancellation feature which works very well, I stop perceiving sounds from around when listening to music.
The headphones come integrated with a microphone that allows me to make and receive phone calls with great clarity. The earphones are touch sensitive which you can tap the side of the earphones to control your music.
Paring it with my cellphone was very easy.
I loved it!",Reviewed in the United States on 6 September 2020,
,"I was weary hearing the comparison tests between these and the other big brand. I've owned several mid range headphones and these are by far the best ones I've tried. Just putting them on the noise cancellation is amazing. I sore these as a backseat passenger a few weeks ago on a 5 hour trip. The people in the front carried on a conversation and I didnt hear a word.Sound quality is nice and crisp. Midrange might lack a bit but moat people wouldn't catch that. The EQ in the app lets you get the perfect sound for your ears. The bass is really good and pretty realistic. The highs hit really good and are well balanced. There are several cool features available in the app. When you remove these from your head,  you have the option to have your music stop. It also stops if you start talking. So integration with Google and Alexa is awesome. Overall I haven't heard of anyone being disappointed in these headphones and would recommend them to anyone.",Reviewed in the United States on 18 September 2020,
,"If you have the money and want a top-tier pair of headphones for modern life, the Sony WH-1000XM4 are the way to go. The combination of high quality Bluetooth codecs, great sound, improved noise cancelling, good battery life, and smart features like autopause and Bluetooth multipoint makes these the best all-around option for most people. One of the best qualities is the fact that you can connect to two devices at once with the multiple bluetooth codecs. Also the chat to take feature is great but takes time to get use to but you’ll need to download the Sony headphones connect app. The comfort is pretty much the same it’s predecessor. I have to mention I do like the pause feature when taking them off. These are great headphones and the sound quality is great as well, the price is somewhat high but you’re paying for the noise canceling technology and brand name.",Reviewed in the United States on 1 September 2020,
,"These are excellent noise cancelling headphones.  They don't sound as good as a similarly price set of wired headphones without ANC, but for what they are they are really good.  They are also very comfortable, and the controls work well.  The Sony app is helpful for getting control over your headphone.  Sound is pretty balances; sometimes I find Sony headphones to have bass that overwhelms.  I've tried a lot of noise cancelling headphones, and these are as good as they come.",Reviewed in the United States on 12 September 2020,
,"These required charging before I used them but after I tried them, they are astounding! The noise cancellation easily drowns out sounds that are a few feet away.

The audio is great in these and the ear covers use various presses to control settings. There is an app for additional settings which is a handy feature.

These are on par with my last high end pair, a Turtle Beach set.",Reviewed in the United States on 30 August 2020,
,"I used to think noise cancellation was an expensive luxury - and they have been expensive.  But these were a good price for a name brand, so I gave them a shot.  Now I don’t think I would ever go back.  They have a companion app that lets you tune them to your preference.  They kill *all* external noise.  It’s still a bit of a luxury - I reserve these for my home (I don’t travel much) - but I believe they are worth the money.",Reviewed in the United States on 1 October 2020,
