3.0 out of 5 stars,"overall the quality music is awesome never had such experience in other headphones
I would recommend buying this,

CONS:
1. The Bluetooth is not so strong to hear a song in a terrace, audio breaks like anything
in a closed room, u won't find anything like a break-in the signal
2. The aux cable is totally not lengthy not suitable for PUBG like games Bluetooth audio is slow for games
and aux is not fitted properly and it's not a dependent one

PROS:
1. good audio, awesome everything to hear and noise cancellation is really good",Reviewed in India on 14 August 2020,NOT THE BEST BLUETOOTH MODE HEADPHONE
2.0 out of 5 stars,"1. Anything you listen, even at 50% volume, is audible to people in other room as well. They should be categorized as mini speakers rather than headphones
2. Aux cable provided in the box is too short for using with laptop/computer
3. Even with music playing, we can hear everything (zero noise cancellation)

Worst product and note that there is no refund for this item => you end up with same piece again!",Reviewed in India on 21 August 2020,stay away!!

  Noise cancellation doesn't work in this product, I tried to return but policy is not allowing me to return and get my refund . hence putting this feedback. I am not happy with such product and quality , I will not recommend this product for official purpose.  Please don't buy and stuck like me .ThanksUmesh Sharma

5.0 out of 5 stars,"I have heard many headphones, but i choose very wisely.

I love this over the ear headphones with a theatre kind of feeling with noise cancellation.

Also one more good good thing is, it comes up with wire if incase battery of bluetooth is not available.

They also call once for support and feedback which i think no headphone company does.",Reviewed in India on 27 July 2020,Great and value for money product.

Packaging was very good. Light weight & Battery backup is commendable. I use it for 4 - 5 hrs continuously, but battery reduction was minimal.
Very good audio quality with passive noise cancellation. Microphone is also very effective with clear sound. Worth every penny. Just go for it. you'll love it.
Overall, best value for money !!",Reviewed in India on 24 September 2020,Best value for money !!

  I am Boult audio thunder user and I am fully satisfied by this product. The notice cancellation is good but then too you can hear loud noises of vehicles. The sound quality is better. The battery life for bluetooth connection is best because If it is fully charged then it can work for almost one day but I the battery gets over then you can continue using it with the help of cord which we get free with it and the cord is also of comfortable length. One thing I didn't liked is that it is sensitive if you hit the speakers then it looses the sound from that side but it automatically gets recovered in one day.

5.0 out of 5 stars,"Ordered this 2 weeks ago and fully charged on Day 1. Since then i haven't charged it yet and still the battery is 10% left. It easily runs for 10 days on a single charge.

Complete noise cancellation ensures you only listen to high quality music.

Would highly recommend this product.

  After use of Boult audio pro bass thunder, I had better experience in terms of noise cancellation and sound quality. Battery performance also good. Once charged it took more than 1 day to discharge after continuation usage. I will strongly recommend to buy.
